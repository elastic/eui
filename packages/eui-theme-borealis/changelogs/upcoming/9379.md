- Added `textInk` and `textGhost` color tokens for text and icon colors that should always remain dark or light regardless of color mode.

**Breaking changes**

- Removed `ink` and `ghost` theme tokens. Use `textInk` / `textGhost` for text and icon colors or `plainDark` /`plainLight` for non-text use cases.
