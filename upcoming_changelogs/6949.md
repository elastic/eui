**Breaking changes**

- `EuiProvider` will no longer render multiple or duplicate nested instances of itself. If a nested `EuiProvider` is detected, that instance will return early without further processing, and will warn if configured to do so via `setEuiDevProviderWarning`. For nested theming, use `EuiThemeProvider` instead.
