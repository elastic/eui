This component is handy for various resizable containers. **EuiResizableContainer** uses
the [React Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render) technique
to provide **EuiResizablePanel** and **EuiResizableButton** components for layout, and `actions` for custom handling
collapse and resize functionality in your app. Wrap parts of your content with the **EuiResizablePanel** component
and put the **EuiResizableButton** component between.

:::note

Consider adding a tabIndex for keyboard accessibility

Add a prop `tabIndex=0` to the **EuiResizableContainer** if it is a fixed height or has a lot of content.
This ensures keyboard users can set focus on the container and scroll to the bottom using arrow keys.

## Horizontal resizing

Simple resizable container with two panels and a resizer between. This is the most common case you'll need in your app.
Just drag **the resizer** button between two panels to increase/decrease panel size. You could also use arrow keys **←**|**→** on **the focused resizer** button to change panel size.

*   add `initialSize` in percents to each panel to specify the initial size of it. Other calculations
    will be encapsulated, you don't worry about it.
*   add `scrollable=false` prop to a panel to eliminate overflow scrolling

## Resizable panel options

Each **EuiResizablePanel** is simply an **EuiPanel** wrapped with a `<div>` for controlling the width.
It stretches to fill its container and accepts all of the same [**EuiPanel**](#/layout/panel) props to style your panel.

The default props clear most of the **EuiPanel** styles, but you can add them back in with `color`,
`hasShadow`, and `paddingSize`.

## Horizontal resizing with controlled widths

Sometimes it's necessary to control panel sizes from the outside. For example to store sizes
in `localStorage` or change the layout with predefined sizes. Here is the `onPanelWidthChange` and `size`
props for help. If you use such an approach, you have to specify an `id` prop for each panel to track their sizes.

:::warning

Required properties

Either `initialSize` or `size` must be specified. The `size` prop is for cases where a parent component
will control sizing updates.

:::

## Vertical resizing

Set `direction=vertical` on **EuiResizableContainer** to set a vertical orientation of the resizable panels.

## Resizable container callbacks

**EuiResizableContainer** supports `onResizeStart` and `onResizeEnd` callback props to listen for when resizing
starts and ends. The `onResizeStart` callback is passed a `trigger: 'pointer' | 'key'` parameter to determine which
user action triggered the resize.

## Collapsible resizable panels

Panels can be designated as collapsible, which allows them to hide content and automatically resize to a minimal width.
The intent of collapsible panels is to enable large, layout-level content areas to cede space to a main content area.
For instance, collapsing an action panel to allow more focus on the primary display panel.

Use the `mode` prop on an **EuiResizablePanel** to mark it as `collapsible` or `main`. From the provided `mode`
configuration, the **EuiResizableContainer** will determine placement of the toggle button and functionality
of panel collapsing. To prevent empty states, not all panels can be `mode=collapsible`
(there must be at least one `mode=main` panel).

## Responsive layout

It is possible to dynamically change the `direction` prop to allow for adapting layouts to screen size.
Resize the window to see the panel orientation change.

## Collapsible panel options

An **EuiResizablePanel** marked as `mode={['collapsible']}` also accepts configuration options for the collapsible
button by passing a second parameter, in the form of:

```jsx
mode={['collapsible', {
  'data-test-subj': 'panel-1-toggle',
  className: 'panel-toggle',
  position: 'top',
}]}
```

## Collapsible panels with external control

**EuiResizableContainer** also provides action hooks for parent components to access internal methods,
such as **EuiResizablePanel** collapse toggling. The actions are accessible via the third parameter
of the render prop function.

Note that when bypassing internal **EuiResizableContainer** logic, it is possible to create situations
that would otherwise be prevented. For instance, allowing all panels to be collapsed creates a scenerio where
your app will need to account for empty state and accesibility in regards to keyboard navigation.

### Custom collapse button

You can also provide an external collapse button for custom placement and look within your panel with
`mode={['custom']}`. When collapsed, however, the default collapsed button will be used for users
to uncollapse the panel.

For consistency, we recommend the usage of the `menuLeft`, `menuRight`, etc, icon types.

## Custom resizable button

If you want to break out of **EuiResizableContainer** usage completely, you may import the standalone
**EuiResizableButton** component. You will need to attach your own mouse, touch, and keyboard events
and logic to the button - see the example below.
