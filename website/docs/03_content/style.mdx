## Spelling

Use **American English** by default. 

## Case

Use **sentence case** by default. The only exceptions are:

- Proper nouns
- Branded terms. For example, Elastic Agent
- Solution names, when actually referring to the Elastic solution, and not the common term. 

## Punctuation

Use **ending punctuation** in sentences, otherwise don't use it. 
Most help content uses regular sentences. On the other hand, navigation items, labels, and links don't require ending punctuation.

## Elastic's voice

The **voice** represents the personality of the product and its main traits.
The following principles define our voice.

### **Real people, writing for real people**

| ✔️ Be...            | How?                                                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human, plainspoken | Be conversational, yet professional. Write close to how you'd talk.         |
| Empathetic, caring | Write what matters to users. Use words that you normally use.               |
| Inclusive, open    | Write for all audiences. Don't use terms that might discriminate or offend. |
| User-focused       | Address users directly. Don't abuse possessive markers like "yours".        |

### **Get the user's job done**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timely      | Help users when it's needed. Not everything is critical to describe in more details.    |
| Informative | Ensure all content serves a purpose and is not just decoration.                         |
| Succinct    | Shorten the content to something meaningful and scannable, without sacrificing clarity. |


### **Empowering and authentic**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inspiring   | Use words that motivate users and help them progress.                              |
| Confident   | Be definite and trustworthy. Delete unnecessary wording. Don't oversell.           |
| Transparent | Help users connect the dots and see the big picture, while giving them the choice. |
