**EuiFacetButtons** are to be used when allowing lists with multiple search params to be filtered down
by these particular params. They allow for an `icon` node and/or `quantity` to be passed.
You can also indicate the current selection with `isSelected`. Other props include `isDisabled`
and `isLoading` (which will swap the quantity indicator with a loading icon).

## Facet layout

Utilize the **EuiFacetGroup** wrapper to correctly layout multiple facets. You can supply a `layout` of either
`horizontal` or `vertical` with the default being `vertical`. Be sure to contain vertical layouts in a skinny component
or give it a max-width. You can also adjust the spacing between items with the `gutterSize` prop.

Typically, each facet grouping should display similarly. For example, they should all have icons or be similar
icon nodes (like avatars). It is up to you whether each group should be single or multi-selection.
