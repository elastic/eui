**Bug fixes**

- Fixed an `EuiDataGrid` bug with `gridStyle.rowClasses`, where custom consumer classes that began with `euiDataGridRow` would not be correctly removed/reapplied
- Fixed a visual `EuiDataGrid` bug where `EuiCheckbox`es within control columns were not vertically centered within single height rows
