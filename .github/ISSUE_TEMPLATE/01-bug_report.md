**Minimum reproducible sandbox**

<!-- 
The EUI team is most likely not familiar with your code and EUI usage, including Kibana. While we can do it, it is often quite hard for us to debug issues directly in Kibana.

Please strive to isolate the issue, if at all possible, in a minimum reproducible sandbox.(All examples on https://eui.elastic.co/ have a CodeSandbox logo in the top-right corner).

This shows us the exact case in EUI in which the bug occurs. If we have this, we can often turn around a fix very quickly.
