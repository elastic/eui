  Our general set of do's and don'ts for testing components and views.

## Choose the right selectors

Follow RTL's [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/)
and [query priorities](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority) when choosing right element selectors.

Prioritize accessible and semantic queries (e.g., `[role="dialog"]`) followed by `data-test-subj` attributes over
other, more complicated and prone to breaking queries (e.g. `div > span.title`) whenever possible.

## Don't use snapshots

**The EUI team strongly discourages snapshot testing**, despite its simplicity.
We find that snapshot tests are prone to frequent failures due to the smallest things, like whitespace changes.
Developers often update stored snapshots when they see them fail without thinking too much about
why the snapshots are failing.

Tests should tell a story and be considered an instant red flag whenever they fail.
They should focus on the important details like the data a component is displaying,
or if the data is coming from a prop or being dynamically calculated.

Instead, consider writing simple but precise assertion tests.

## Avoid time-based waits

Sometimes the easiest solution to fixing a test is adding a wait/sleep call. In most cases, though,
this can't be considered a reliable fix, because:

1. It greatly increases total test run time, especially when used often
2. Every machine will take a different amount of time to execute the code, and some &mdash; especially CI runners
&mdash; are prone to lag during the test run.

Instead, use the utilities available for every testing framework to wait for elements to appear
or for asynchronous operations to finish execution.
