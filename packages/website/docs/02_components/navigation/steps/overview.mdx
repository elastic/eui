**EuiSteps** presents procedural content in a numbered outline format. It is best used when presenting instructional
content that must be conducted in a particular order. It requires a `title` and `children` to be present
and will automatically increment the step number based on the initial `firstStepNumber`.

## Complex steps

If you need to call out a set of substeps that are not lines of code, most likely a `<ol/>`,
wrap the block in a `<EuiSubSteps/>`.

## Heading elements

To aid with accessibility and hierarchical headings, you can and should pass in a heading element
to use for each step title. The example below shows that the logical heading element should be an `h2` and
therefore adds `headingElement="h2"` to the EuiSteps component.

The style of the title will **not** be affected.

## Steps status

Steps can optionally include `status` prop that will alter the look of the number prefix.
The options are `incomplete`, `complete`, `warning`, `danger`, `disabled` and `loading`.
This is used mostly as a final step when you need to make some sort of final check.

## Custom title sizes

You can set a different title size using `titleSize`. If `titleSize` is set in both **EuiSteps** and **EuiStep**,
the latter value will override the former. Additionally, the title size `xs` will automatically
generate smaller steps circles.

## Horizontal steps

For use when forms/setup instructions can and should be split into multiple pages.
Each step should correspond to an individual page of form elements, using the `status` key to denote
the user's progress.

For horizontal steps, the `status` key defaults to `"incomplete"` and the default filled styling is reserved
for indicating `"current"` status.

Use the `size` property to generate smaller step circles.
