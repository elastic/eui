:::warning

In some cases, aspect ratio sizing may not be supported by the embed.
This component will only work with ones that do, like YouTube.

:::

**EuiAspectRatio** provides a way to responsively resize a single block level child element to a specified ratio.
This is useful for things like YouTube iframes or other embeds that initially have a fixed size.
If you need something similar for images, take a look at CSS's
[object-fit property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit).
