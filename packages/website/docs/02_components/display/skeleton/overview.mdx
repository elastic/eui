The **EuiSkeleton** components are placeholder components for content which has yet to load.
They provide meaningful previews, avoid layout content shifts, and add accessible announcements
to screen readers when content is done loading.

:::note

Using the `contentAriaLabel` prop

The `contentAriaLabel` prop should be used to help describe the type of content that is loading
to screen reader users. If you do not provide a descriptive label and have multiple loading skeletons
on the page, screen reader users may hear a multitude of “Loaded” messages in a row,
with no meaningful indication of what actually loaded.

## Text

Use **EuiSkeletonText** to display a placeholder for multiple lines of text.

<!-- TODO: Add text example -->

## Title

Use **EuiSkeletonTitle** to display a placeholder for heading titles.

<!-- TODO: Add title example -->

## Circle

Use **EuiSkeletonCircle** to display a circular preview, mainly for avatars.

<!-- TODO: Add circle example -->

## Rectangle

**EuiSkeletonRectangle** allows you define a large and customizable shape via its `width`, `height`,
and `borderRadius` props.

<!-- TODO: Add rectangle example -->

## Combining multiple skeletons

**EuiSkeletonLoading** is a light wrapper around the **EuiSkeleton** components that handles loading accessibility
and flipping between skeleton and loaded content.

As you may have noticed in the previous demos, toggling multiple skeletons to their loaded state all at once triggers
multiple queued screen reader announcements, which can be annoying to SR users.

To circumvent this, use **EuiSkeletonLoading** to handle a single parent-level `isLoading` state. **EuiSkeleton**
children passed to the `loadingContent` should not have their own `isLoading` props or children.

<!-- TODO: Add combining skeletons example -->

## Customizing screen reader announcements

**EuiSkeleton** components assume that the page starts as loading and transitions to loaded, and the default
screen reader experience is set up accordingly (`announceLoadedStatus={true}`).

In scenarios where that is not the case (i.e., transitioning to loading), you can customize what statuses
are announced to screen readers by setting `announceLoadingStatus` to true, or `announceLoadedStatus` to false.
Submitting the below example announces a loading status, but not a loaded status.

As an optional escape hatch, `ariaLiveProps` is also available and accepts
any [**EuiScreenReaderLive**](#/utilities/accessibility#screen-reader-live-region) props.
