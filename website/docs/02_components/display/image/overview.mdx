Use **EuiImage** when you need to place a static image into a page with an optional caption.

:::note

Writing meaningful image alt text

This page has several examples of alt text written to aid screen reader users, as well as several examples of when
_not_ to include alt text. When an image is decorative, or if the image is adequately described by surrounding text,
it is better to pass an empty `""` string instead.

When an image is not already sufficiently described, the alt text passed should help non-visual users understand
the purpose of the image within the context of the overall page.
See [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) for a more detailed guide to writing effective alt text.

## Click an image for a fullscreen version

Apply the `allowFullScreen` prop to make the image clickable and show a fullscreen version.
Note that the second image also passes `fullScreenIconColor="dark"` to change icon color to better contrast
against the light background of that image.

<!-- TODO: Add click to fullscreen example -->

## Images can be sized

Images can be sized by passing the `size` prop a value of `s / m / l / xl / original / fullWidth / number / string`.
This size sets the **maximum** length of the longest edge of the image, whether that is height or width, and scales it.
Only the provided sizing values will also increase the size of a smaller image.

## Supporting SVG images

If you are using an SVG source within `EuiImage`, the SVG image may not show up! While this is surprising to the user,
if your image doesn't have a width or viewbox set, it is behaving in accordance with the SVG spec.

In order to work with an SVG image that lacks a defined size, you'll want to set a `size` prop.
If you are using the `allowFullScreen` prop as well, you will also want to add a `width` prop.

## Float images within text

When using `EuiImage` within `EuiText` it is often useful to apply floats. Almost always you'll want to pair
the `float` prop usage, with a `margin` prop usage to give space around your image. Margins, when used in combo
with floats, will adjust depending upon the position of the float.

:::warning

Be careful with floats

Floats should only be used on images within **large** bodies of text.
Specifically, we only suggest using them with `EuiText` which comes automatically clears floats.
