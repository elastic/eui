**EuiPageTemplate** offers a quick way to
[apply a bottom bar to your page layouts](#/templates/page-template#showing-a-bottom-bar).

:::

**EuiBottomBar** is a simple wrapper component that does nothing but affix a dark bar (usually filled with buttons)
to the bottom of the page. Use it when you have really long pages or complicated, multi-page forms.
In the case of forms, only invoke it if a form is in a savable state.

Like many of our other wrapper components, **EuiBottomBar** accepts a `paddingSize` prop,
which can be set to `s | m (default) | l | none`.

## Positions

Bottom bars default to a fixed position, in a portal at the bottom of the browser window.
Alternatively, you can change the `position` to `sticky` where it will render in place but stick to the window only
as the window edge nears. The `static` position reverts back to default DOM behavior.

You can also apply a different set of positioning locations just by adjusting
them in with the `top | right | bottom | left` props.

## Displacement

There is an `affordForDisplacement` prop (defaulting to `true`), which determines whether the component makes room
for itself by adding bottom padding equivalent to its own height on the document `<body>` element.
Setting this to `false` can be useful to minimize scrollbar visibility but will cause the bottom bar
to overlap body content.
