**EuiStat** can be used to display prominent text or number values.
It consists of `title` and `description` elements with several visual styling properties (examples below).

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Color variants

`title` can be altered using the color property. By default, it will appear in `full` color.
For proper color contrast, only a limited set of EUI colors are offered. See the Props tab above
for a list of available colors.

## Text alignment

**EuiStat** also offers alignment options. By default, text will be left aligned.

## Title size

`title` uses the **EuiTitle** component and thus uses the same sizing property values
(applied via the `titleSize` property). Although all **EuiTitle** sizes are available, suggested sizes
include `'l' | 'm' | 's' | 'xs' | 'xxs' | 'xxxs'`. By default, the size is set to large `'l'`.
The `description` label cannot be re-sized via component properties.

## Reverse the order

You can reverse the order of the `description` and `title` text by setting the `reverse` property to true.
By default, the description (label) is displayed above the title (value).

## Stat loading

If you apply the `isLoading` prop, the title will indicate the loading status by swapping the provided title
with two flashing dashes.

## Component variants

In the following example, you can see variants of how the **EuiStat** component can be assembled.
This component is very helpful for constructing single-value visualizations and summaries for different dashboards
and page layouts and for communicating trends over time.
