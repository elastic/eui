# Selection controls

EUI currently offers over 4 ways to select an option from a list (6 including checkboxes and radios).

While it can get overwhelming figuring out which component to use, this page should serve as a handy guide to help you make that decision depending on what features you need.

## Which selection component should I use?

### Single selection

- When you have a small set of options (\<7) and all options are equally important in terms of visibility, use [EuiRadioGroup](./checkboxes_radios/overview.mdx#radio-group).
- When you have a small set of options (\<12) and only the current selected option has UI importance, reach for [EuiSelect](./select.mdx) first when possible, over other more complex selection components.
    - Native form controls tend to have better cross-browser and cross-device affordances (particularly for mobile devices), and are more familiar to end users due to their ubiquity across the internet.
- When you have a small set of options (\<12) _and_ if you need to customize how the options are rendered and selected, use [EuiSuperSelect](./super_select.mdx).
    - We recommend reaching for **EuiSuperSelect** only if custom option display is absolutely necessary (e.g. for multi-line option text/descriptions), as **EuiSelect** is natively more accessible.
- Large sets of options (\>12) should use a selection component that supports searching/filtering options. This requires the use of one of the more advanced multiselect components with `singleSelection` set.

### Multiple selections

- When you have a small set of options (\<7), and all options are equally important in terms of visibility, use [EuiCheckboxGroup](./checkboxes_radios/overview.mdx#checkbox-group).

<!-- TODO: Once EuiComboBox is rewritten to dogfood EuiSelectable, the below will no longer be as true, and we can recommend either EuiSelectable or EuiComboBox equally -->

- In general, we recommend using [EuiSelectable](./selectable.mdx) for most multi-selection purposes. It renders a searchable, vertically-oriented list with icons next to the option representing selection state.
    - **EuiSelectable** can optionally be rendered with a search box for filtering through many options, or as just a list for fewer options.
    - **EuiSelectable** is by far our most accessible and flexible selection component (although customization may require extra development). It can be used within popovers and flyouts, or as a standalone list.
    - If you need the ability to exclude options, **EuiSelectable** is the only component that offers that functionality.
- In general, for multi-select scenarios, we recommend using [EuiComboBox](./combo_box.mdx) over [EuiSelectable](./selectable.mdx) primarily when selections should be immediately visible and unselected options should not. Selections are rendered as a horizontally-oriented list of pills.
    - **EuiComboBox** also allows users to search through a list of dropdown options. This functionality is core to the component and cannot be removed, unlike **EuiSelectable**.
    - If you need the ability to dynamically add custom user-generated input outside of the available options, **EuiComboBox** is the only component that offers that functionality.

## Feature comparison chart

Below is a handy reference for comparing the selection components.
