These guidelines are intended for all content authors, whether you are a developer, a designer or a writer. 
This page is not exhaustive but provides some guidelines to write inclusive content for product content and technical documentation.

## What is inclusive content and why does it matter

**Inclusivity** for content means making sure that the content we serve reflects the diversity of our community, respects it, and promotes positive change. 


## Guidelines

### Write for an international audience
 
Our products and documentation use American English (en_US) as a standard for written content. 
Yet they are used, read by persons all around the globe, for whom English is not always their primary language.
Our content must take that into account.

✔️ **Aim for simplicity.** Indeed, we are a technical company, writing for 
  technically-savvy users. However, it benefits everyone if we try to keep our 
  writing as simple as possible.

  * **Short sentences** - They leave less space for interpretation. They are easier to scan, read and translate.

  * **Plain language** -  Active voice, present tense, using examples, and so on. 
  Some of these guidelines might already look familiar. Several countries have 
  [plain language initiatives](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) to 
  promote clearer communication. Do your 
  best to embrace these guidelines and focus on the message, we’re not going for 
  Scrabble high scores and no one is carrying a thesaurus to read our docs. 
  Well, maybe the writers...

  * **Negation** - It is generally easier on everyone to say what something IS 
  versus what it is NOT. When you add a negative construction, it takes the 
  reader longer to parse the meaning of the phrase. Instead of saying "You 
  cannot access the content without signing up" versus how much easier it is to 
  read "Sign up to access the content."

  * **Words with multiple meanings** - 
  Don't skip helper words if they make the sentence clearer, easier to read. 
  We try to be as literal and unambiguous as possible in our docs to ensure that 
  they can be easily consumed by our readers from around the globe. One way to 
  achieve that is to choose words that have fewer meanings, especially when a 
  word's intended meaning is not its primary meaning.

✔️ **Be aware of differences and diversity in content and examples.** 
Different people are used to different names, currencies, date and time formats, different units of measurement (like for temperature, distance, speed), and so much more. 
* Avoid ambiguous values, like `04/05/06` for a date. Is it May 4 or April 5, and which year? `11/17/1987` leaves less room for interpretation if the exact format is not specified nearby. 
* If there is no obvious example standard (RFC) to follow, try to be diverse to represent our audience.

✔️ **Avoid idioms or expressions that are not commonly known, a.k.a regionalisms.** 

In our Elastic documentation we aim for a fun, friendly, and sometimes quirky 
tone. To achieve that, it can help to use informal, playful language. However, 
we also have to be careful that our text is as inclusive as possible, so we try 
to avoid expressions that might be unknown or opaque for some readers. Here are 
a few examples of what to avoid:
  
* Idioms (for example, _It's a piece of cake_ or _So far so good_)
* Regional expressions (for example, _G'day!_, _Y'all_, or _eh_)
* Sports expressions (for example, _touched base_ or _threw a curve ball_)
* Pop culture references (for example, _Elvis has left the building_ or _Same bat-time, same bat-channel_)

We're all pretty good at avoiding these, but there's one problematic type of 
expression that shows up frequently in docs reviews. Latin terms and 
abbreviations are a common source of confusion, particularly for people whose 
first language does not have Latin roots.

Here are some terms to avoid and suggested alternatives:

| Avoid      |  | Use instead     |
--- | --- | ---
| _e.g._ (exempli gratia) | → | _for example_ | 
| _etc._ (et cetera) | → | _and more_ or _and so on_ |
| _i.e._ (id est) | → | _that is_ |
| _via_ | → | _by way of_, _by means of_, or _through_ |

✔️ **Aim for readability.** Tools like the Hemingway App can help you make content simpler. Be conversational, but prioritize clarity.

### Prefer gender-neutral language

Writing gender-neutral mainly consists in avoiding gender bias and word choices implying that one gender is the norm.

✔️ **Pronouns.** In technical documentation and product UI, this is avoided most of the time by addressing users directly.
When it's not possible, use *they*/*their*, even for singular. There's more than one gender, and it's not binary either.

✔️ **Biased words and expressions.** Guys, mankind, policeman... Words that we're all used to hear and use. But the default is not male. 
Most expressions and words that perpetuate this bias (that exists in many cultures and languages!) can be replaced with neutral alternatives or synonyms: Folks, humanity, police officer...

### Avoid violent, offensive, ableist terminology

Earlier in this page, we discussed avoiding ambiguous terms, especially when a word's intended meaning is 
not its primary meaning. Other types of words and phrases best avoided are:

* buzzwords (_incentivize_, _synergies_)
* superhero terms (_rockstar_, _wizard_, _ninja_)
* violent imagery (_crush the competition_)
* non-specific superlatives (_unrivaled_, _unparalleled_, _world class_)

Some words have nuances that fall into the above categories, which may cause 
them to be misinterpreted. Here are some suggested alternatives:

| Avoid      |      | Use instead   |
--- | --- | ---
| Abort	     | → | _stop_, _cancel_, or _end_ |
| Boot 	     | → | _start_ or _run_ |
| Execute     | → | _run_ or _complete_ |
| Hack (noun) | → | _tip_ or _workaround_ |
| Hack (verb) | → | _configure_ or _modify_ |
| Hit (verb)  | → | _click_ or _press_ |
| Hit (noun)  | → | _visits_ (as in _website visits_) |
| Invalid     | → | _not valid_ or _incorrect_ |
| Kill		  | → | _cancel_ or _stop_ |
| Terminate	  | → | _stop_ or _exit_ |
