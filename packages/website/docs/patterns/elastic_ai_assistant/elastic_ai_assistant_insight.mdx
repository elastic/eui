# Contextual insight
The contextual insight is an in-product and context relevant message.

A contextual insight's main purpose is to assist users by offering information or suggestions based on their current and past interactions, preferences, and workflows. Insights are answers to questions a user might have when interacting with content, exploring an event, asset or process.

## When to use

Use it to explain different signals, events or processes. The footer can allow for other custom actions like the recommended steps for the contextual view.

#### Example

When opening a flyout displaying a log message's details, a contextual insight gives an explanation of what that message means.

## Structure

Every insight allows for initiation of a conversation, regeneration and feedback provision. An insight has two interaction states:

1. **Collapsed**

   />

2. **Expanded**

   />

### Contextual insight skeleton

A contextual insight consists of three main areas:

1. **Header** - the header is customisable, offering a snapshot of the insight, hinting at the deeper information available upon expanding the panel.
2. **Body** - the body servers as the core information center, providing a detailed explanations or analysis relevant to the current context. The content can include text or other widgets.
3. **Footer** - the footer acts as the actionable segment, containing calls-to-action and offering options to regenerate, or delve further into the insight
