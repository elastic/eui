- Updated `EuiDescriptionList` with a new `columnGutterSize` prop

**Breaking changes**

- Renamed `EuiDescriptionList`'s `gutterSize` prop to `rowGutterSize`
- `EuiDescriptionList`'s `rowGutterSize` prop now defaults to a size of `s` (was previously `m`)
- `EuiDescriptionList` now applies a max width to both titles and descriptions. If necessary, this can be overridden with custom CSS.
- Inline `EuiDescriptionList` title colors have been tweaked slightly
