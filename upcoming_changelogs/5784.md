**Breaking changes**

- `EuiPopover`s will no longer focus the first tabbable child by default - instead, the popover panel will be focused. This change should be a better experience for both keyboard and screen reader users. Consumers who want to set an initial focus on specific popover element should use the `initialFocus` prop.
