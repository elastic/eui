### Use tabs to organize in-page content

Each tab should contain a segment of information relevant to the current subject. For more UX tips see [NNG's article "Tabs, Used Right"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/).

### Do not use tabs to update global navigation

Tabs should keep users on the same page, visually, and not change the higher-level navigation, logically. Tabs should keep users at the same place within an application. Breadcrumbs and main navigation should not change. The URL hash is the only thing that should change.

### Sync the `selectedTab` with the URL

Ensure when a page is loaded with a URL hash representing a selected tab (as applied by the `href` prop), that the corresponding tab is shown using the `selectedTab` prop.

### Use `href` for primary page content

For tabs showing primary page content, use the `href` prop to change the current URL hash. Ensure the tab selection is persisted in the user's navigation history and works with the browser's back button.

### Do not update the URL when multiple `EuiTabs` are in use on the same page

Apply the `href` prop to change the current page URL hash on more than one set of tabs per page, or non-primary content.
