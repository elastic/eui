          <EuiCode>EuiDelayHide</EuiCode> is a component for conditionally toggling
          the visibility of a child component. It will ensure that the child is
          visible for at least 1000ms (default). This avoids UI glitches that
          are common with loading spinners and other elements that are rendered
          conditionally and potentially for a short amount of time.
