# Word choice

Find the right term to use in your UI copy.

## Use these preferred words and terms

Use these words and terms in the scenarios described in the following table:

| Word | Usage notes |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **add** | Use for establishing a new relationship. Often used in create-then-add scenarios. Create a dashboard, then add a visualization. In button labels, always follow _add_ by an object. Remove is the correct opposite. |
| **cancel** | Use to stop an action without saving pending changes. |
| **can't** | Use to indicate you don't have the ability to do something. Often confused with _unable_. |
| **create** | Use for creating an object from scratch. In button labels, always followed by an object. Do not use _create new_. Delete is the correct opposite. |
| **delete** | Use when deleting data that users can no longer retrieve. Create is the correct opposite. |
| **edit** | Don't use _change_ or _modify_. Edit is the better choice for localization. |
| **enter** | Use when the user enters text. Don't use _type_. |
| **later** | Use when referring to versions of the product. For example, Elastic Stack 8.13 and later.
| **open** | Use when opening an application or program. Don't use _launch_. |
| **press** | Use _press_ for keyboard keys. Don't use _hit_.
| **remove** | Use when removing a relationship, but not permanently deleting the data. For example, you remove a visualization from a dashboard. Add is the correct opposite. |
| **select** | _Select_ is preferred over _choose_. |
| **use**| Use instead of _utilize_ and _make use of_. |
| **view** | Use instead of _see_ because _view_ is more inclusive. |

## Avoid these words and terms

This section includes terms that you should avoid in most instances. These terms might be offensive, non-inclusive, unclear, or unnecessary.
Use the alternate suggestions in the following tables or a more specific term.

### Latin abbreviations

Latin abbreviations can be unclear.
Use the following suggestions instead:

| Word | Usage notes |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **e.g.** | Use _for example_ or _such as_ instead. |
| **i.e.** | Use _that is_ instead.|
| **via** | Use _with_, _by using_, or _through_ instead. |

### Directional language

Directional language does not meet accessibility requirements and you should avoid it, especially as the only way to find an element in the UI.
Use the following suggestions instead:

| Word | Usage notes |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **above** | Use a link, _previous_, or _preceding_ instead. |
| **below** | Use a link or _following_ instead|

### Nouns created from verbs

Avoid using nouns created from adjectives or verbs.
These words often make text unnecessarily complex.
For example:

- Use _choose_ instead of _make a choice_.
- Use _register_ instead of _complete your registration_.
- Use investigate instead of _conduct an investigation_.

| **blacklist** | Use _blocked list_ instead. |
| **boot** | Use _start_ or _run_ instead. |
| **bottom left, bottom right** | Use _lower left_ or _lower right_ instead. Hyphenate when using as an adjective. For example, lower-left corner. |

## Use caution with these words and terms

These words and terms might be appropriate in some situations and inappropriate in others.
Only use them when appropriate.

| Word | Usage notes |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **app**, **application**| Use only when needed for clarity. Otherwise, a Kibana application name can stand alone. App is a well-known abbreviation for application and is preferred. |
| **begin** | Use context to decide between _begin_ and _start_. For example, _begin a procedure_, _begin an analysis_, or _begin an installation_ are common phrases. Similarly, _start a program_, _start an engine_, or _start a timer_ are frequently used. _Start_ is considered less formal than _begin_. _End_ is the correct opposite of _begin_.|
| **can** | Use for capability. Rewrite as an action if possible. For example, instead of _you can add..._ use _add..._. |
| **click** | Acceptable to use when describing mouse actions. Otherwise, use verbs that work with multiple devices, such as _select_. |
| **clone** | Use when creating a copy that is linked to the original. Often confused with _copy_ and _duplicate_. |
| **copy** | Use when the file is added to a clipboard and can be pasted in a new location. Often confused with _clone_ and _duplicate_. |

| **duplicate** | Use when immediately creating a copy of an object in the same location as the original. Often confused with _copy_ and _clone_.  |
| **kill** | Use _cancel_ or _stop_ unless the actual command is `kill`. |
| **may** | Use _may_ for permissibility. Use _can_ for capability. Use _might_ for possibility. |
| **start** | Use context to decide between _start_ and _begin_. For example, _start a program_, _start an engine_, or _start a timer_ are common phrases. Similarly, _begin a procedure_, _begin an analysis_, or _begin an installation_ are frequently used. _Start_ is considered less formal than _begin_.|
| **unable** | Unable means not being able to perform an action. Often confused with _cannot_. |
