:::info Colors and accessibility

Never rely solely on color to convey meaning. Colors can be overridden by [system forced colors](../high_contrast_mode.mdx#forced-contrast-themes-and-colors), or can be difficult to distinguish for different users.
Always combine color context with accompanying [icons](../../display/icons/overview.mdx) or [copy](../../guidelines/writing/guidelines.mdx) to indicate states such as error, activity, etc.
