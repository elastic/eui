        <EuiCode>EuiTableOfRecords</EuiCode> is a high level component that aims to simplify and unifiy the way
        one creates a table of... (wait for it....) records!!!

      <EuiCallOut iconType="questionInCircle" title="What is a High Level Component?">
        The goal of a high level components is to make the consumer not think about design or UX/UI behaviour.
        Instead, the consumer only need to define the functional requirements - features of the component (in
        this case, table), the data, and the type of interaction the user should have with it. Through high level
        components, Eui can promote best/common UI practices and patterns.

        High level components are as stateless as they can possibly be. Meaning, all the management of the data
        (e.g. where is it coming from, how is it loaded, how is it filtered, etc...) is expected to be done
        externally to this component. Typically one would use a container component to wrap around this component
        that will either manage this state internally, or use other state stores (e.g. such as Redux).

      <EuiCallOut iconType="questionInCircle" title="What is a Record?">
        Think of a record in a data store - typically it represents an entity with a very clear

          <EuiCode>config</EuiCode> - This is the configuration of the table. It provides all information the

        </li>
        <li>
          <EuiCode>model</EuiCode> - This object provides the table two things - the <b>data</b> (the records that
          should be shown), and the <b>criteria</b> of the data. The criteria effectively describes what data is
          show and how it was collected.

              <strong>Pagination</strong> - enabled when the provided model specifies the pagination criteria (i.e.
              <EuiCode>model.criteria.page.index</EuiCode> and <EuiCode>model.criteria.page.size</EuiCode>)
            </li>

              <strong>Custom Column Rendering</strong> - You can customize how the data is displayed in each column by
              specifying a renderer for that column. You can also specify the data type for that column (this will serve
              as a rendering hint for the table, such that it&apos;ll choose the most suitable rendering defaults for the
              data type).

              actions will &quot;folded&quot; into a menu popup.

            Event though the table tries to dictate our common design patterns rules, at times these rules
            need to be broken for good reaosns. For example, there can be a valid use case for having muliple
            controls visible all the time (that is, not collapsed into a popover).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can achieve this by using custom columnRenderers. The following example, enables switching the online/offline
            status of a person. Also note how listening to selection state changes enables us to follow the design
            guidelines and disable these switches when selection is on.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a bonus, we show how you can define a <EuiCode>computed</EuiCode> column that is not associated with any
            specific record key and simply renders content that is computed/derived out of the record itself (here we
            added a small little icon column that shows the user icon that is colored based on the person&apos;s
            <EuiCode>online</EuiCode> status).
