:::note

Coloring and padding exist for examples only

Padding and background-color are added to all the **EuiFlexItem** components on this documentation page
for illustrative purposes only. You will need to add padding through additional components or classes if you need it.

## Flex group is for a single row layout

**EuiFlexGroup** is useful for setting up layouts for a **single row** of content.
By default any **EuiFlexItem** within **EuiFlexGroup** will stretch and grow to match their siblings.

## Flex items are also flex

To allow for continued stretching of nested **EuiFlexGroup**'s and its items, each **EuiFlexItem** also has
the property of `display: flex`. This can cause unwanted layouts of your content when there are multiple elements
or if the element itself also has some specific `display` property.

To alleviate this, the simplest method is to wrap your inner children with a simple HTML element
like a `<div />` or `<span />`.

## Spans instead of divs

Specify `component=“span”` on **EuiFlexGroup** and/or **EuiFlexItem** to change from the default `div`.

## Panels grow to fill flex items

The [**EuiPanel**](#/layout/panel) component will naturally grow to fill the **EuiFlexItem** which contains it.

## Turn off item stretching

Sometimes you do not want a **EuiFlexItem** to grow horizontally. It can be turned off for each item individually.

## Proportional widths of items

You can specify a number between 1 and 10 for each **EuiFlexItem** to take up a proportional percentage
of the **EuiFlexGroup** it is in.

## Justify and align

**EuiFlexGroups** have the props `justifyContent` and `alignItems` that accept
[normal flexbox parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container).
Below are some common scenarios, where you need to separate two items, center justify a single one,
or center an item vertically. Note the usage of **EuiFlexItems** with `grow=false` so that they do not stretch.

## Allowing flex items to wrap

You can set `wrap` on **EuiFlexGroup** if it contains **EuiFlexItems** with minimum widths,
which you want to wrap as the container becomes narrower.

## Change direction

You can change direction using the `direction` prop.

## Responsive flex groups

By default **EuiFlexGroup** is responsive by always stacking the items on smaller screens.
However, often you only want to use groups for alignment and margins, rather than layouts.
Simply apply the `responsive={false}` prop to retain a single row layout for the group.

## Flex grids are for repeatable items

**EuiFlexGrid** is a more rigid component that sets multiple, wrapping rows of same width items.
You can set a `columns` prop to specify anywhere between 1-4 columns. Any more would likely break on laptop screens.

## Flex grids can change direction

Adding `direction="column"` will re-orient the flex items so they display top-down **then** left to right.

## Responsive flex grids

**EuiFlexGrid** is also similarly responsive by default, responsive by always stacking the items vertically
on smaller screens. However, should you want to customize the number of items on small or large screens, we recommend
applying the `responsive={false}` prop and then conditionally pass a column number based on the current breakpoint.

## Flex grids and flex groups can nest

**EuiFlexGroup** and **EuiFlexGrid** can nest within themselves indefinitely.
For example, here we turn off the growth on a **EuiFlexGroup**, then nest a grid inside of it.

:::warning

Flex items are also a flexbox

To support nested stretching of items, **EuiFlexItem** also has `display: flex` on it so if your children
are not behaving correctly, you may want to wrap them in a `<div />`.

## Gutter sizing[](#/layout/flex#gutter-sizing)

The `gutterSize` prop can be applied to either a **EuiFlexGroup** or a **EuiFlexGrid** to adjust
the spacing between **EuiFlexItems**.
