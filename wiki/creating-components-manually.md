# Creating components manually

## Create component SCSS files

1. Create a directory for your component in `src/components`.
2. In this directory, create `_{component name}.scss`.
3. _Optional:_ Create any other components that should be [logically-grouped][docs-logical-group] in this directory.
4. Create an `_index.scss` file in this directory that import all of the new component SCSS files you created.
5. Import the `_index.scss` file into `src/components/index.scss`.

This makes your styles available to your project and to the [EUI documentation][docs].

## Create the React component

1. Create the React component(s) (preferably as TypeScript) in the same directory as the related SCSS file(s).
2. Export these components from an `index.ts` file.
3. Re-export these components from `src/components/index.js`.

This makes your React component available for import into your project.

## Document the component with examples

1. Create a directory for your example in `src-docs/src/views`. Name it the name of the component.
2. Create a `{component name}_example.js` file inside the directory. You'll use this file to define the different examples for your component.
3. Add the route to this file in `src-docs/src/services/routes/routes.js`.
4. In the `{component name}_example.js` file you created, define examples which demonstrate the component and describe its role from a UI perspective.
