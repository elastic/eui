Some EUI components have pagination built-in, like [**EuiBasicTable**](#/tabular-content/tables),
but for custom built paginated interfaces you can use **EuiPagination** manually.

ExamplesGuidelines

## Basic usage with many pages

**EuiPagination** accepts a total `pageCount` and only shows up to 5 consecutive pages,
with shortcuts to the first and/or last page. It also requires the parent component to maintain
the current `activePage` and handle the `onPageClick`.

For accessibility, it is highly recommended to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for each pagination set.

## Few pages

The UI simplifies when we have fewer than the maximum number of visible pages.

## Centered pagination

You can use [**EuiFlexGroup**](#/layout/flex) to center the pagination in a layout.

## Compressed and responsive

Use the `compressed` prop to minimize the horizontal footprint. This will replace the numbered buttons
with static numbers and rely on the first, last, next and previous icon buttons to navigate.

This is also the same display that will occur when `responsive` is **not** `false`.
You can adjust the responsiveness by supplying an array of [named breakpoints](#/theming/breakpoints)
to `responsive`. The default is `['xs', 's']`.

## Indeterminate page count

If the total number of pages cannot be accurately determined, you can pass `0` as the `pageCount`.
This will remove the button numbers and rely solely on the arrow icon buttons for navigation.
Without a total page count, the last page button will pass back `-1` for the `activePage`.

## Table pagination

You can use **EuiTablePagination** to create a combination "Rows per page" and pagination set,
commonly used with [tables](#/tabular-content/tables#adding-pagination-to-a-table).
If you pass `0` in as one of the `itemsPerPageOptions`, it will create a "Show all" option and hide the pagination.

## Customizable pagination

Or you can use [**EuiFlexGroup**](#/layout/flex) and [**EuiContextMenu**](#/navigation/context-menu#with-single-panel)
to set up your own custom pagination layout.
