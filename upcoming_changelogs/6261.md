- Added the `fallbackDestination` prop to `EuiSkipLink`, which accepts a string of query selectors to fall back to if the `destinationId` does not have a valid target. Defaults to `main`
- `EuiSkipLink` is now always an `a` tag to ensure that it is always placed within screen reader link menus.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed custom `onClick`s passed to `EuiSkipLink` overriding `overrideLinkBehavior`
