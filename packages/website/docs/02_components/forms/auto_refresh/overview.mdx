This is a component that is used by the [**EuiSuperDatePicker**](#/templates/super-date-picker) component
to create an automatic refresh configuration. It merely provides a common UI pattern but the actual refresh
counter is maintained by you. It `isPaused` by default and the `refreshInterval` is set in milliseconds.

## Auto refresh button

If you're looking for a more compact version, you can use **EuiAutoRefreshButton**,
which is the same button that is appended to **EuiSuperDatePicker**.
For even more compactness, add `shortHand={true}` to reduce the active unit to a single letter.

## Refresh interval

For even more customizablity, you can use the **EuiRefreshInterval** component which simply provides the form inputs.
