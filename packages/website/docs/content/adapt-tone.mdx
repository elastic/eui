# Tone

Adapt the way you write to each situation users can face.

During the users' journey with Elastic, there are times for excitement and discovery, but also times for help, support, and empathy.

## Stimulating

**Attributes**

    We're proud to show new and cool stuff. Be:

    - Motivational
    - Excited
    - Enthusiastic

    When using this tone, you may:
    - Use exclamation marks, but sparingly.
    - Take time to help the user understand how this feature benefits them.
    - Use visuals to support your text.

**When to use?**

    Although it can be very visible because of the way it's written and the UI elements it shows in, the **stimulating** tone is used **quite rarely** overall.

    We use it when we want to show new things to users, especially in:

    - Product tours
    - New feature announcements


## Informational

**Attributes**

    E=MC². Be:

    - Direct
    - Straight to the point
    - Neutral

    When using this tone:
    - Use a minimum of words.
    - Write for scanning and help users quickly locate what matters to them.
    - Use action verbs to:
        - Label selection controls.
        - Describe what settings do or what to do with a setting.
    - Use clear nouns for
        - menus, form field names


**When to use?**

    The **informational** tone is the **most used** one. It is everywhere in the UI, and sometimes seems so normal that we forget about it. Yet, it is very important!

    We use it for naming and describing things:

    - Menus, titles, setting names, hint text, placeholders, introductions, and descriptions
    - In-product assistance (tooltips, help popovers, setup guides, syntax references, etc.)
    - Information callouts
    - Confirmation modals
    - Calls to action (buttons and links)
    - Event logs


## Supportive

**Attributes**

    Something might be wrong and requires attention. Let us help you. Be:

    - Reassuring
    - Serious
    - Urgent

    When using this tone, you may:
    - Be more action-oriented than usual to offer direct paths to users.
    - Focus on what went wrong. Don't be apologetic.
    - Help users learn how something happened, how to prevent it, how to fix it.
    - Provide clear actions, or clearly state it if there's no action needed.


**When to use?**

    The **supportive** tone is used **sparingly** overall and is usually shown in places that draw the user's attention, for example in warnings and error messages.

    We use it when notifying users of things that require attention, especially in:

    - Errors
    - Licensing or billing-related content
    - Vulnerability and remediation content
    - Warnings and cautions
    - Upgrade and deprecation notices


## Stern

**Attributes**

    We don't advise this action, but you're the master of your destiny. Be:

    - Deterring
    - Heavy with caution
    - Advisory

    When using this tone, you may:
    - Use stronger words that highlight possible negative effects.
    - Format the content in a way that make the risks stand out.

**When to use?**

    The **stern** tone is **rarely** used. Reserve it for very specific cases, and for advanced or administrative features.

    We use it when insisting on the high risks an action could pose, especially in:

    - Danger type of warnings
    - Unsupported actions
