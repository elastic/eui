The header is made up of **many** individual components starting with **EuiHeader** as the container.
You can manually configure your header with the following related components:

*   **EuiHeaderSection**: Left/right containers with flex properties.
*   **EuiHeaderSectionItem**: Containers for individual header items as flex items.
*   **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton**: Specialized button that extends
    [**EuiButtonEmpty**](#/navigation/button#empty-button) but styled to fit the height of the header
    with additional `notification` props.
*   **EuiHeaderLogo**: A helpful component for creating a linked logo that fits within the header sizing.
*   **EuiHeaderBreadcrumbs**: A set of [**EuiBreadcrumbs**](#/navigation/breadcrumbs) specifically stylized
    to fit inside the header.

## Sections

Alternatively, you can pass an array of objects to the `sections` prop that takes a key of `items`
(array of children to wrap in an **EuiHeaderSectionItem**) and/or `breadcrumbs`
(array of [breadcrumb](#/navigation/breadcrumbs) objects). Each item in the array will be wrapped
in an **EuiHeaderSection**.

**Note:** Passing `sections` and `children` will disregard the `children` as it is not easily interpreted
at what location the children should be placed.

## Header links

In addition to the components mentioned prior, which lend themselves to more application style navigation patterns,
**EuiHeaderLinks** and **EuiHeaderLink** supply the ability to inline a list of navigational or menu style links.

**EuiHeaderLinks** comes with responsive functionality built-in which will convert the inline list of links
to a popover list triggered by a **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton**. You can adjust at which breakpoints to switch
to the popover display by passing your own array of named breakpoints to `popoverBreakpoints`.

## Fixed header

Most consumers need a header that does not scroll away with the page contents. You can set this display by applying
the property `position="fixed"`. Multiple fixed headers will automatically stack underneath one another.
No manual positioning is required.

If you're using [**EuiPageTemplate**](#/templates/page-template), a padding top will be automatically set based
on the number of fixed headers on the page. [**EuiFlyouts**](#/layout/flyout) will also automatically account
for and sit below fixed headers.

If you're using your own custom layout, or have custom UI that needs to sit below your fixed header(s),
EUI provides a global CSS `var(--euiFixedHeadersOffset)` variable. You can use this variable anywhere,
or even override it, to correctly offset any and all fixed header heights.

## Dark theme

To make site-wide navigation more prominent, **EuiHeader** supports reversing the colors to dark theme
with `theme="dark"`. However, it only supports a **limited set of children** that will also shift their theme.
These components include **EuiHeaderLogo, EuiHeaderLink(s),** **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton**
and **EuiSelectableTemplateSitewide**. Any other content may not render correctly without custom configurations.

## Portal content in the header

Use an **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton** to display additional information in [popovers](#/layout/popover)
or [flyouts](#/layout/flyout), such as a user profile or news feed. When using [**EuiFlyout**](#/layout/flyout),
be sure to wrap it in a [**EuiPortal**](#/utilities/portal). When using an [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover)
in conjunction with a **fixed** header, be sure to add the `repositionOnScroll` prop to the popover.

The example below shows how to incorporate **EuiHeaderAlert** components to show a list of updates inside
a [**EuiFlyout**](#/layout/flyout) and a [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) .

## Header notifications

To alert or notify users about the additional information they are receiving, use the **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton**
`notification` prop. You can pass a `node` that will render inside a **EuiBadgeNotification** or pass `true`
to render a simple dot. You can also animate the button by calling the `euiAnimate()` method
on the **EuiHeaderSectionItemButton** `ref`.

## Stacked headers

Stacking multiple headers provides a great way to separate global navigation concerns.

## The Elastic navigation pattern

### Putting it all together

The button below will launch a fullscreen example that includes two **EuiHeaders** with all the appropriate
navigation pieces including [**EuiCollapsibleNav**,](#/navigation/collapsible-nav) **EuiHeaderAlerts**, user menu,
deployment switcher, space selector, **EuiHeaderBreadcrumbs** and **EuiHeaderLinks** for app menu items.

This is just a pattern and should be treated as such. Consuming applications will need to recreate the pattern
according to their context and save the states as is appropriate to their data store.
