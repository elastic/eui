## General style recommendations

### Spelling 
Use **American English** by default. 

### Minimalism

- Be straight to the point.
- You don't need to explain everything at once. Make information discovery progress at the same pace as the user.
- Help text and descriptions are optional. If it doesn't add value other than decoration, omit it. Make every word play a role and earn its place.
- Don't sacrifice clarity for the sake of minimalism.

### Conversational voice 

- Use contractions
- Prefer active voice
- Converse directly with the user using "you" and "your".
- Use "We" when talking about actions Elastic takes for users. But don't overdo it, we respect the user and explain things transparently. Let's not use "let's".
- Our audience is global. Avoid complex words and phrasal verbs such as "jump in".
- Name things. Avoid verbs alone without a noun, for example in buttons. Also avoid "this" alone, and attach a noun to it: "this setting", "this plan".

> Sometimes, we give the user full ownership of an action. In that case, it's acceptable to use "I" and "my". For example, for a legal agreement checkbox "I agree to follow the terms of service".

- **Do:** We noticed that you don't have any data in your cluster. Try our sample data and dashboards or bring your own data.
- **Don't:** Let's create a visualization.

### Adverbs

Use adverbs sparingly. If you can omit a word, do it.

## Case

Use **sentence case** by default. This goes for navigation menus, titles and headers, buttons, and so on. 

- **Do:** Developer tools. Data streams. Index templates. Save session. 
- **Don't:** Developer Tools. Delete Deployment? Run Search.

The only exceptions are proper nouns and [branded terms](https://brand.elastic.co/302f66895/p/194a3b-writing-style-guide/t/159934) like solution and application names. 

- **Do:** Elastic Observability. Go to the Discover app. Upgrade to Platinium.
- **Don't:** Select gold subscription. Open the synthetics app.

Note that some names don't need to be capitalized when they're used as common names. For example, **Elastic Cloud Serverless** and **our serverless architecture** are both correct.

## Punctuation

### Ellipsis

Reserve ellipsis only for indicating truncated text or situations that require the user to wait.

- **Do:** Page loading...
- **Don't:** Elastic offers many capabilities such as dashboards, machine learning, synthetics monitoring...

### Exclamation mark

Don't use exclamation marks unless you are sharing an exciting news. And if you are, only use one.

### Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma before the final item in a list.

- **Do:** Elastic's solutions are Elasticsearch, Observability, and Security
- **Don't:** Elastic's solutions are Elasticsearch, Observability and Security

### Periods (full stops)

Don't use periods in headers, titles, placeholders, and navigation labels. Use them on description text, messages, and notifications. Don't use them in a bulleted list unless the list item is a complete sentence.

- **Do:** Developer tools
- **Don't:** Developer tools.

## Elastic's voice

The **voice** represents the personality of the product and its main traits.
The following principles define our voice.

### **Real people, writing for real people**

| ✔️ Be...            | How?                                                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human, plainspoken | Be conversational, yet professional. Write close to how you'd talk.         |
| Empathetic, caring | Write what matters to users. Use words that you normally use.               |
| Inclusive, open    | Write for all audiences. Don't use terms that might discriminate or offend. |
| User-focused       | Address users directly. Don't abuse possessive markers like "yours".        |

### **Get the user's job done**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timely      | Help users when it's needed. Not everything is critical to describe in more details.    |
| Informative | Ensure all content serves a purpose and is not just decoration.                         |
| Succinct    | Shorten the content to something meaningful and scannable, without sacrificing clarity. |


### **Empowering and authentic**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inspiring   | Use words that motivate users and help them progress.                              |

| Transparent | Help users connect the dots and see the big picture, while giving them the choice. |
