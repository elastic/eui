# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are our responses to questions we expect to get frequently.

## What is the Elastic UI Framework?

The Elastic UI Framework (EUI) is a design library in use at Elastic to build **internal products** that need to share our branding and look and feel. It distributes UI React components and static assets for use in building web layouts. Alongside the React components is a SASS/CSS layer that can be used independently on its own.

## Can I use EUI?

The Elastic UI Framework is intended to only be used on Elastic products and is not supported as a discrete, independent design library. We do not recommend using it unless you are working on Elastic products or plugins to those products.

## Why is EUI open source?

Many of our products themselves are open source and rely upon this library to function. The Elastic UI Framework began as a folder of code in Kibana and we decided it could be used beyond that codebase. It exists as an independent library so that patterns can be shared across teams and design standards can be scaled across our organization. Since most of our products are open source, we treat this one similarly as far as public publishing and conversation even if its usage tends to focus more inward towards Elastic itself.

## What about reporting bugs and feature requests?

Bug reports are most welcome, but we're not considering external feature requests at this time.
