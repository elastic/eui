# Icons

**EuiIcon** is a handy component for using our custom glyphs and logos.
The `type` prop accepts either an enumerated name from one of the sets below,
a location to a custom SVG asset, or a React Element.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

For better accessibility it's always recommended to give a descriptive `title` based on the icon use.

If no title is provided the icon is going to be purely decorative, and it will get by default an `aria-hidden=true`.

## Glyphs

Glyphs are small, monochromatic icons that typically should always use the default size of `size="m"`.
They are named according to their appearance or the action they represent. For example, `star`, `play`, etc.

If you would like to contribute to our growing list of glyphs, you can follow
[these guidelines](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/contributing-to-eui/developing/creating-icons.md).

## Editor controls

Editor icons relate to the visual styling of elements and are commonly used within **EuiButtonGroup** components.

## Elastic logos

These logos are restricted in use to Elastic products or when referencing Elastic products.
They are multicolor with some internal paths having a class of `.euiIcon__fillNegative` to handle flipping colors
for dark mode. The only other colors most of them support are ghost and text which turn them into a solid shape.

## Apps

App logos are logos for Elastic Apps, and can contain multiple colors. Normally the Elastic Design team
creates those icons. They are not meant to be used outside of Elastic, because they represent our apps.
App logos are usually displayed at `32x32` or above and can contain multiple colors.

### Machine learning icons

Machine learning has some specific icons for job creation. Again, these are made for `32x32`.

## Tokens

Tokens are most commonly used to visually signify field or code types. An **EuiToken** accepts any valid **EuiIcon**
as its `iconType` property. However, icons designed specifically for use in the **EuiToken** are prefixed
with "token" in their name and have pre-defined styles.

<!-- TODO: Add tokens glyphs table -->

## Custom tokens

By default, an `iconType` with the token prefix (i.e. those listed above) will have predefined styles.
However, any valid `iconType` can be passed and, in either case, the `shape`, `size`, `color`, and `fill` can be customized.

<!-- TODO: Add custom tokens example -->

## Sizes

Use the `size` prop to automatically size your icons. Medium is the default, and will output a `16x16` icon.

<!-- TODO: Add sizes example -->

## Colors

The default behavior of icons is to inherit from the text color. You can use the `color` prop to assign
a custom color which accepts a named color from our palette
or a valid [CSS color data type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) which
will be passed down through the inline-style `fill`  property. **We recommend relying on the EUI named color
palette** unless the custom color is initiated by the user (like as a graph color).

Two-tone icons, like our app style icons, will behave similarly to normal glyphs when provided a specific color
by applying the color to **all** the shapes within. You can force the icon to match the parent's text color by
passing `color="inherit"` to the icon.

<!-- TODO: Add colors example -->

## Custom SVGs

The `type` prop can accept a valid enum, string or React SVG Element. When using a custom SVG, please make sure
it sits on a square canvas and preferably utilizes one of EUI's sizes (`16x16` or `32x32`).

When using custom SVGs for simple glyphs, **remove all fill attributes** on the SVG and utilize the CSS helpers
if you have complex logos that need to work with theming.

:::warning

Important considerations when importing SVGs as components

When importing an SVG as a component like `import { ReactComponent as ReactLogo } from './logo.svg';`,
keep in mind that the component will not support the `title` prop. The `title` prop is designed to only work with
our icons or SVGs imported as images or passed as a Data URL. So, if you're importing your SVG as a component,
be sure to use an `aria-label` instead of a `title` prop to enhance accessibility and avoid potential issues.
