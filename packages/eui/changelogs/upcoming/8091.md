**Accessibility**

- Ensures `autoFocus` on `EuiSelectableList` triggers initial focus
- Improved the accessibility of `EuiSearchBarFilters` by: 
  - adding a more descriptive `aria-label` to selection filter buttons
  - ensuring the selection listbox is initially focused when opening a selection popover
