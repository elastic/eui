## Form and form rows

Use the **EuiFormRow** component to easily associate form components with labels, help text, and error text.
Use the **EuiForm** component to group **EuiFormRows**. By default EuiForm will render as a simple div unless
you pass `component="form"`.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Full-width

Form elements will automatically flex to a max-width of `400px`. You can optionally pass the `fullWidth` prop
to the row and form control to expand to their container. This should be done rarely and usually you will only
need it for isolated controls like search bars and sliders.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Global full-width

To set all the row and controls in a form to `fullWidth`, specify the prop on the root `EuiForm` component.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Inline

Inline forms can be made with [**EuiFlexGroup**](#/layout/flex). Apply `grow={false}` on any of the items you want
to collapse (like the button below). Note that the button's **EuiFormRow** wrapper also requires an additional prop
when it’s missing a label `hasEmptyLabelSpace`.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

### Sizing inline form rows

Apply a `width` or change the `grow` prop on the wrapping **EuiFlexItem** to size individual controls.
When you need to make a field smaller, always apply the width to the flex item, not the input.
The input inside will resize as needed.

When supplying children to an **EuiFormRow** that is **not** a form control, and you need to the content
to vertically center with the other form controls, change the `display` prop to `center` or `centerCompressed`.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Described form groups

Use **EuiDescribedFormGroup** component to create sections of associated form controls and rows.
It can also simply be used with one **EuiFormRow** as a way to display additional text next
to the field (on mobile, it will revert to being stacked).

Read more about appropriate layout usage of **EuiDescribedFormGroup**
in the [forms usage guidelines](#/forms/form-layouts/guidelines).

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

### Sizing described form rows

By default, **EuiDescribedFormGroup** has a max-width of 800px for best readability.
To expand the group to 100%, add the `fullWidth` prop to this, the **EuiFormRow**, **and** the individual fields.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

You can also change the ratio of the width of the description column versus the field column.
By default, it is `'half'`, but you can also change to `'third'` or `'quarter'` which prioritizes the field column.
You will most likely still need to apply `fullWidth` to all the components. The description column does have
a minimum readable width applied to it so that it cannot shrink too far.

Both the description and field columns are simply **EuiFlexItem** wrappers. If you need more customization
of these columns you can pass flex item props to `descriptionFlexItemProps` and `fieldFlexItemProps` respectively.

## Form labels

The best way to provide an [accessible name](https://www.tpgi.com/what-is-an-accessible-name/) to form elements
is to use the `label` prop provided by **EuiFormRow**. However, certain types of form controls require extra care
to ensure an accessible experience. Below are just a few examples.

Form controls that come with their own label don‘t need the one provided by **EuiFormRow**.
For controls like `EuiSwitch`, `EuiButton`, and `EuiLink` be sure to pass `hasChildLabel={false}`
to the wrapping **EuiFormRow**.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

### Implicit titles for the first form control

When displaying the form control's name in some other way than through the visual `label` prop,
the form control still needs to be associated with that element. To do this, either:

*   duplicate the text and pass it as the `aria-label` of the form control, or
*   pass the `id` of the text to the form control's `aria-labelledby`.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

### More complicated form labels

Some controls are just hard though and will often require some custom work.
Refer to an individual component‘s documentation and remember to test with a screen reader!

## In a popover

Because forms auto-size to their wrapping elements, it means you can do fun things with them like stuff them
in popovers, and they’ll still work perfectly.
