Also known as **Editor-Style Controls**, compressed forms and controls were specifically created for use when space
is at a premium. They are not intended for use when the form is the main objective of the page.
They work best in editor-style applications where form controls are being used to create or edit content on the page.

:::danger

Do not use compressed and non-compressed form controls in the same form.

:::

To use compressed forms, pass `display="rowCompressed"` to the EuiFormRows and `compressed=true`
to the form controls themselves.

## Column layout

Editor-style controls can be displayed in a two column layout for even better use of limited space,
just pass `display="columnCompressed"` to align the labels and inputs side by side.

**EuiSwitches** are a special case in which so you must pass `"columnCompressedSwitch"`
to the EuiFormRow as the display property.

## Contextual help

When using compressed, horizontal form styles, it is best not to overload the UI with expansive help text.
If it's short and part of the validation, use `helpText`. However, if it's an explanation of the control,
consider wraping the label with an [**EuiToolTip**](#/display/tooltip) and appending the `questionInCircle` icon to it.

## In a popover

Always use the compressed version of forms and elements when they exist inside a [popover](#/layout/popover).

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Complex example

This is an example of how to combine compressed form controls with from rows, labels,
prepend and appends in a column layout.

:::warning

Pay close attention to the patterns of using `htmlFor` and `aria-label`.
For best results, each form control that is not wrapped in an EuiFormRow should be supplied an `id`.
