# Performance

The main task of Emotion is parsing stylesheets defined in JavaScript
and injecting them into DOM, so that the browser can properly style elements.
Emotion is _really good_ at doing that and handles many
optimizations by default, so you don't have to think about it.
It can't predict every scenario, though, and there are a few things you
should do to ensure styles are injected and referenced efficiently.

## Dynamic styles

Dynamic styles, or more precisely, styles that change dynamically based
on external factors like props or browser events (e.g., scrolling),
are probably the biggest factor when it comes to performance.
It can be completely fine to rely on values like the above if you follow
a few rules.

:::note
Most importantly, you should pay close attention to how and where you declare
`css` template literals to reduce recomputation.

### Where should I declare my styles?

You should always declare `css` template literals outside components
and other blocks of code that might get executed more than once within
the runtime of the app.

`css` style declarations must be pure. If your style changes based
on an external value (e.g., a button variant prop), the style must be declared
as a pure function, meaning for given input the function must return
the same output.
