:::tip Wrap your form controls in a form row

Use the [EuiFormRow](./row.mdx) component to easily and accessibly associate form components with labels, help text, and error text.
Keep in mind that **EuiFormRow** controls the `id` of its wrapped child form component to associate it with the label and help text.
