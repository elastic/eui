          This PR contains breaking changes. The opener of this pull request is asked to perform the following due diligence steps below, to assist EUI in our next Kibana upgrade:
          - If this PR contains **prop/API changes**:
              - [ ] Search through Kibana for `<EuiComponent` usages ([example search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aelastic%2Fkibana+%3CEuiAccordion&type=code))
              - [ ] In the PR description or in a PR comment, include a count or list with the number of component usages in Kibana that will need to be updated (if that amount is "none", include that information as well)
          - If this PR contains **CSS changes**:
              - [ ] Search through Kibana for the changed EUI selectors, e.g. `.euiComponent` ([example search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aelastic%2Fkibana+.euiAccordion&type=code))
              - [ ] In the PR description or in a PR comment, include a count or list with the number of custom CSS overrides in Kibana that will need to be updated (if that amount is "none", include that information as well)
          - 🔍 Tip: When searching through Kibana, consider excluding `**/target, **/*.snap, **/*.storyshot` files to reduce noise and only look at source code usages
          - ⚠️ For extremely risky changes, the EUI team should potentially consider the following precautions:
              - Using a [pre-release](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/eui-team-processes/releasing-versions.md#pre-release-process) release candidate to test Kibana CI ahead of time
              - Using [`kibana-a-la-carte`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/contributing-to-eui/testing/testing-in-kibana.md#testing-in-the-cloud) for manual QA, and to give other Kibana teams a staging server to quickly test against
