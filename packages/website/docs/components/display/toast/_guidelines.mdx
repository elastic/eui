import { EuiButton, EuiCallOut, EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiSpacer, EuiToast } from '@elastic/eui';

This page documents patterns for using toasts, short messages that appears on the lower right corner and time out after a few seconds. They are a popular design choice because they don't need to fit in a layout and don't disrupt the user.

<EuiSpacer />

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
    <EuiToast
      style={{ width: 300 }}
      title="Your report is complete"
      color="success"
    />
  </EuiFlexItem>
  <EuiFlexItem>
    **Success toasts indicate that everything worked out.**\
    They are the most-commonly used toasts.
  </EuiFlexItem>
</EuiFlexGroup>

<EuiSpacer />

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
    <EuiToast
      style={{ width: 300 }}
      title="Node 726 is having trouble"
      color="warning"
    />
  </EuiFlexItem>
  <EuiFlexItem>
    **Warning toasts direct user attention to a potential problem.**\
    You should receive a warning message when the program detects that something is not behaving right, but it didn't cause any termination.
  </EuiFlexItem>
</EuiFlexGroup>

<EuiSpacer />

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
    <EuiToast
      style={{ width: 300 }}
      title="Search failed.  Check your Elasticsearch connection."
      color="danger"
    />
  </EuiFlexItem>
  <EuiFlexItem>
    **Error toasts report a problem.**\
    You should receive an error message when the issue is terminal, this doesn't always mean that the operation stops completely, but the task is not complete.
  </EuiFlexItem>
</EuiFlexGroup>

<EuiSpacer />

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
    <EuiToast
      style={{ width: 300 }}
      title="Please wait while your report is created"
      color="primary"
    />
  </EuiFlexItem>
  <EuiFlexItem>
    **Info toasts relay neutral information.**\
    The default toast, an info toast might notify users about an ongoing action.

## Use a toast for a timely message

Toasts are appropriate for short feedback related to a user action. A toast should contain a message about a current action, not a historical action.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Use a toast for a brief message about the current action.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Your folder was moved"
      color="success"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Greet users with a toast when they open a page.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Haven't seen you in a while"
      color="primary"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Most often, it's a single line of text

By default, a toast stays on the screen 10 seconds. Users should be able read the message in 6 to 7 seconds. The message should get straight to the point and rarely include more than one line.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="A single line of text is readable at a glance.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Check your form for errors"
      color="danger"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Cram a lot of detail into a toast. These errors should persist in callouts and validations on the form. They don't need to be spelled out in the toast.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Your form has errors"
      color="danger"
    >
      <ul>
        <li>Username is a required field.</li>
        <li>Password must be at least 6 characters long.</li>
        <li>Email is a required field.</li>
      </ul>
    </EuiToast>
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Toasts should only contain a single action

A toast can have a single action, styled as a standard button. If more actions are needed, or if the action is important enough to interrupt the user, use a modal instead.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Use only one action per toast and favor a one-word label. Align actions to the right, which follows our button guidelines for usage within restricted width containers.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      color="success"
      title="Your report is complete"
    >
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'right' }}>
        <EuiButton size="s">Download</EuiButton>
      </div>
    </EuiToast>
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Use multiple actions. Don't align buttons in toasts to the left. This message is better in a confirmation modal.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="All messages will be deleted"
      color="danger"
    >
      <EuiFlexGroup justifyContent="flexEnd" gutterSize="s">
        <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
          <EuiButton size="s">Cancel</EuiButton>
        </EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
          <EuiButton size="s" color="danger">Delete</EuiButton>
        </EuiFlexItem>
      </EuiFlexGroup>
    </EuiToast>
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Icons should emphasize actions

An icon on the left of the message can help define the message type.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="The check icon reinforces that the action succeeded. The error icon helps users understand the message is an error.">
     <EuiToast
        style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
        title="Your dashboard was updated"
        iconType="check"
        color="success"
      />
      <EuiSpacer />
      <EuiToast
        style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
        title="A dashboard named 'MyDashboard' already exists"
        iconType="error"
        color="danger"
      />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Use icons that are hard to understand. They distract from the message.">
    <EuiToast
      color="primary"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Message sent"
      iconType="help"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Display one toast at a time

Users should be able to take in all the details from one toast before the next one arrives.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Display one toast at a time.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      color="primary"
      title="3 new messages"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Stack toasts.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      color="danger"
      title="There was a problem with your node"
    >
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'right' }}>
        <EuiButton size="s">Learn more</EuiButton>
      </div>
    </EuiToast>
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiToast
      color="primary"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="3 new messages"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Keep messages as short as possible

For common actions such as create, add, delete, remove, and save, include the object type, the object name if available, and the past tense of the action.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Include the object name if it's not too long. Use single quotation marks around the object name if it helps clarify meaning.">
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="User 'Casey Smith' was added"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text={`Use the generic "Your object."`}>
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Your object has been saved"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

Don't include the word "successfully." It's implied.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Use this format for a success message.">
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Dashboard 'My_dashboard_with_a_very_long_name' was saved"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text={`Include "successfully."`}>
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Dashboard 'My_dashboard' was successfully saved"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

For a message about multiple objects, include the object count, but not the names of the objects.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Include the object count.">
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="4 visualizations were deleted"
    />
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Overwhelm the user by listing the names of all the objects.">
    <EuiToast
      color="success"
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      title="Visualization 1, Visualization 2, Visualization 3, and Visualization 4 were deleted"
    />
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>

## Use call-to-action buttons when the content needs more room

Occasionally, the content of a toast is too involved to fit into the constrained space of a toast. This is common in long error messages. In these cases use the toast to deliver the summary of the information and use a button to provide a call-to-action for the full message.

<EuiFlexGroup gutterSize="m">
  <Guideline type="do" text="Use the toast message to provide a summary and a button to link to the full content.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      color="danger"
      title="Your visualization has an error"
    >
      <p>The maximum bucket size of 200 was exceeded.</p>
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'right' }}>
        <EuiButton size="s" color="danger" onClick={() => {}}>See the full error</EuiButton>
      </div>
    </EuiToast>
  </Guideline>
  <Guideline type="dont" text="Cram a lot of content into the small space of a toast.">
    <EuiToast
      style={{ maxWidth: 300 }}
      color="danger"
      title="Your visualization has an error"
    >
      <EuiCallOut
        title="The maximum bucket size of 200 was exceeded"
        color="danger"
      >
        <p>An extremely long error trace.</p>
      </EuiCallOut>
    </EuiToast>
  </Guideline>
</EuiFlexGroup>
