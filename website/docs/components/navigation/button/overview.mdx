EUI provides many types, colors and configurations of buttons. The one best suited for you context depends on placement,
prominence, and state. For primary and secondary actions it is best to use the basic **EuiButton**.
For tertiary or low prominence actions, use **EuiButtonEmpty**.

Be sure to read the full [button usage guidelines](#/guidelines/button).

## Basic button

The most standard button component is **EuiButton** which comes in two styles and two sizes. The `fill` style should be reserved for the main action and limited in number for a single page. Use the small size (`size="s"`) when placing buttons into smaller containers like popovers.

When using colors other than `primary`, be sure that either the words or an icon also represents the status. For instance, don't rely on color alone to represent dangerous actions but use words like "Delete" not "Confirm". The `text` and `accent` colors should be used sparingly as they can easily be confused with other states like disabled and danger.

## Empty button

Use **EuiButtonEmpty** when you want to reduce the importance of the button, but still want to align it to the rest of the buttons. It is also the only button component that supports down to size `xs`.

## Flush empty button

When aligning **EuiButtonEmpty** components to the left or the right, you should make sure they’re flush with the edge of their container, so that they’re horizontally aligned with the other content in the container.

## Buttons with icons

All button components accept an `iconType` which must be an acceptable [**EuiIcon**](#/display/icons) type. Multi-color icons like app icons will be converted to single color. Icons can be displayed on the opposite side by passing `iconSide="right"`.

## Icon buttons

An **EuiButtonIcon** is a button that only contains an icon (no text). Use the `display` and `size` props to match the appearance of your **EuiButtonIcon** to other standard buttons. By default they will appear as `xs`, `empty` buttons.

:::warning


**EuiButtonIcon** requires an `aria-label` to express the meaning to screen readers.

## Buttons as links

Every button component accepts either an `href` (rendered as an `<a>`) or an `onClick` (rendered as a `<button>`).
While they also accept both props to be applied simultaneously to support certain routing mechansims,
it is not usually recommended. For more specific information on how to integrate EUI buttons with react-router,
[see this wiki page](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/consuming-eui/react-router.md#how-react-router-works).

If you are creating a purely text-based link, like the one in the previous paragraph,
use [**EuiLink**](#/navigation/link) instead.

## Loading state

Setting the `isLoading` prop to true will add the loading spinner or swap the existing icon for the loading spinner
and set the button to disabled. It is good practice to also rename the button to "Loading…".

## Split buttons

EUI [does not support](https://github.com/elastic/eui/issues/4171) split buttons specifically. Instead,
we recommend using separate buttons for the main and overflow actions. You can achieve this by simply using
the `display` and `size` props **EuiButtonIcon** to match that of the primary action button.

## Toggle buttons

You can create a toggle button with any button type like the standard **EuiButton**, **EuiButtonEmpty**,
or **EuiButtonIcon**. Use state management to handle the visual differences for on and off.
Though there are two **exclusive** situations to consider.

1.  If your button changes its readable **text**, via children or `aria-label`,
then there is no additional accessibility concern.

2.  If your button only changes the **visual** appearance, you must add `aria-pressed` passing a boolean
for the on and off states. All EUI button types provide a helper prop for this called `isSelected`.

:::warning

Do not add `aria-pressed` or `isSelected` if you also change the readable text.

:::

## Button groups

An **EuiButtonGroup** is for indicating **selection** only. They utilize the `type="single"` or `"multi"`
prop to determine whether multiple or only single selections are allowed per group.

:::warning

In order for groups to be properly read as groups with a title, the `legend` prop is **required**.
This is only for accessibility, however, so it will be visibly hidden.

:::

### Icon only button groups

If you're just displaying a group of icons, add the prop `isIconOnly`.

### Button groups in forms

When using button groups within compressed forms, match the form elements by adding `buttonSize="compressed"`.
Compressed groups should always be `fullWidth` so they line up nicely in their small container **unless** they are icon only.

For a more detailed example of how to integrate with forms,
see the ["Complex example"](#/forms/compressed-forms#complex-example) on the compressed forms page.
