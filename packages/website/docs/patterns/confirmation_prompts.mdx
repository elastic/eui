# Confirmation prompts

Add safeguards that catch the user's attention before validating an action.

## Confirming an action
Use a [Modal](../components/layout/modal/overview.mdx#confirm-modal) when you need to interrupt a user and ask them to confirm an action.

**Structure**
1. **Title** _mandatory_
    - Whenever possible, frame it as a question that provides context for the action. Don't use "Are you sure?"
    - Focus the question on what's important to the user and in a way that assumes intent from them. For example `Discard 7 changes?` instead of `Exit without saving?`
    - Avoid including text variables in the title, especially for things users can input without character limits, or with long limits. This is often the case with object labels.
    For example, `Apply configuration changes?` instead of `Apply configuration changes to Loremipsum-dolorsitamet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit deployment?`
2. **Body** _mandatory_
    1. **Cause** _optional_
        - If the context is important to know, add it.
    2. **Consequences** _mandatory_
        - Let users know what happens if they continue.
        - If possible, list the objects that may be impacted.
        - Don't repeat the title.
    3. More information optional
        - If necessary, anticipate user questions or need for help by including a link to a relevant source of information (like docs).
3. **Calls to action** _mandatory_
    - The main action confirms the question asked in the title.
    - If there's enough space and it is relevant, include the number of impacted objects and their noun. For example `Invite 3 users` instead of `Send invite`.
    - Always provide a secondary CTA that allows users to leave the prompt without taking an action.
    - Not all choices are binary. Add a third CTA when it makes sense for common that actions users would want to do.
    - Make sure each CTA is explicit and not ambiguous with the other CTAs next to it.

## Confirming a destructive action
Asking to confirm a delete or remove action follows the same principles as the default pattern, with 2 additions:

- The main CTA is extra clear on what is about to be deleted with a clear noun, in addition to visual clues (`color.danger` token).
- The body is unambiguous about what wonâ€™t be recoverable after the action is confirmed.
- Optionally, and depending on the importance of the destructive action, you may include an extra confirmation within the **body** of the modal. If you do so, use something generic, such as "delete" or that users can copy easily that will remind them of what they are actually deleting.
