The **EuiEmptyPrompt** is the building block to create an empty state. You can use it as a placeholder
for any type of empty content. They are especially helpful for replacing entire pages or parts of a product
that contain no content.

Be sure to read the full [empty prompt usage guidelines](#/guidelines/empty-prompt).

While no one piece of content is required, each **EuiEmptyPrompt** should contain at least
a `title` (wrapped in an HTML heading element) and/or a `description`. They usually contain one or more
`actions` that promotes the primary call-to-actions. You can also provide a `footer` to direct users
towards making informed decisions.

## Less content, more actions

You can remove parts of the prompt to simplify it. You can also provide an array of multiple actions.
Be sure to list primary actions first and secondary actions as empty buttons.

<!-- TODO: Add less content example -->

## Panel options

The **EuiEmptyPrompt** is wrapped by [**EuiPanel**](#/layout/panel). By default, the panel is set to `transparent`
but you can customize other panel options like `color`, `hasBorder` and `paddingSize`. Changing the `color` prop will
also attempt to adjust the `iconColor` and `footer` color.

Read the [usage guidelines](#/guidelines/empty-prompt) to better understand when to use certain panel props.

## Title sizes and icon colors

Other customization options include changing the `titleSize` to any of the [**EuiTitle** sizes](#/display/title)
and `iconColor`. When using an application or solution logo as the `iconType`, you can reset to the multi-tone
colors with `iconColor="default"`

## Loading and error prompts

Empty prompts can also be used to emulate loading and error states, by utilizing the same patterns.

For **loading** states, instead of passing a `iconType`, you can provide a custom `icon`
and pass in one of our [loading components](#/display/loading).

<!-- TODO: Add loading state example -->

For **error** states, you can simply set the `color` to `danger`.

## Layout

You can supply a `layout` of either `"horizontal"` or `"vertical"` with the default being `vertical`.
When creating empty states we want the content to be short and straight to the point. So most of the time,
the `vertical` layout is enough. All the content will be center aligned and this type of text alignment
only works with small content.

When you have longer body text with multiple calls to action, you can use the `horizontal` layout.
This layout works best when you can provide a larger graphic like an illustration as the `icon`. For consistency,
we recommend providing the illustration using a [**EuiImage**](#/display/image) with `size="fullWidth"`.

## More types of empty states

**EuiEmptyPrompt** can be used for more than just **empty** pages. The following example showcases different types
of empty states that you can create with the **EuiEmptyPrompt**.
For a full list see the [usage guidelines](#/guidelines/empty-prompt).

## Using in a page template

When using a **EuiEmptyPrompt** in a [**EuiPageTemplate**](#/templates/page-template),
we recommend using the namespaced component so the template can determine which how to display the empty prompt based
on the rest of the template configuration.

The following example shows the usage
of the [**EuiPageTemplate.EmptyPrompt**](#/templates/page-template#empty-pages-or-content) namespaced component.

<!-- TODO: Add using in a page template example -->

You can then tie multiple types of empty states together to create a seamless loading to empty or loading
to error experience. The following example shows how to incorporate these states with
[**EuiPageTemplate.EmptyPrompt**](#/templates/page-template#empty-pages-or-content).
