The **EuiCommentList** is a timeline component built on top of [**EuiTimeline**](#/display/timeline).
It allows you to display comments or logged actions that either a user or a system has performed.

:::warning

For accessibility, it is highly recommended to provide a descriptive `aria-label` or the ID of an external label
to the `aria-labelledby` prop of the **EuiCommentList**. A `timelineAvatarAriaLabel` should be provided
for every **EuiComment** with or without a `timelineAvatar` as `IconType`.

:::

## Basic comment list

Use **EuiCommentList** to display a list of **EuiComments**.
Pass an array of **EuiComment** objects and **EuiCommentList** will generate a comment thread.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Comment

The **EuiComment** is flexible and adapts the design according to the props passed.

<!-- TODO: Add comment example and reintroduce highlight areas

1. `timelineAvatar`: Shows an avatar that should indicate who is the author of the comment.
   To customize, pass a `string` as a `EuiIcon['type']` or a a [**EuiAvatar**](#/display/avatar).
   Use in conjunction with `timelineAvatarAriaLabel` to pass an aria label to the avatar. If no avatar is provided,
   it will default to an avatar with a `userAvatar` icon.
2. `eventIcon`: Icon that shows before the username. Use in conjunction with `eventIconAriaLabel` to pass
   an aria label to the event icon.
3. `username`: Author of the comment.
4. `event`: Describes the event that took place.
5. `timestamp`: Time of occurrence of the event.
6. `actions`: Custom actions that the user can perform from the comment's header. When having multiple actions,
   consider grouping them in a nested menu system using a [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) with
   a [**EuiContextMenu**](#/navigation/context-menu).
7. `children`: A user message or any custom component.

The following demo shows how you can combine different props to create different types of comments events like
a regular, update, update with a danger background and a custom one.

## Timeline avatar

The timeline icon is a very important part of the comment:

* By default, each **EuiComment** shows an avatar with the `userAvatar` icon. A `timelineAvatarAriaLabel` should
  be provided when using this default option.
* You can customize your avatar by passing to the `timelineAvatar` any of the icon types that
  [**EuiIcon**](#/display/icons) supports. The icon will show inside a `subdued` avatar. Consider this option when
  showing a system update. Providing a `timelineAvatarAriaLabel` is recommended.
* You can further customize the timeline icon by passing to the `timelineAvatar` a [**EuiAvatar**](#/display/avatar).

## Comment event actions

There are scenarios where you might want to allow the user to perform `actions` related to each comment.
Some common `actions` include: editing, deleting, sharing and copying. To add custom `actions` to a comment,
use the `actions` prop. These will be placed to the right of the metadata in the comment's header. We recommend
using a [**EuiButtonIcon**](#/navigation/button) to trigger an action. When having multiple actions, consider
grouping them in a nested menu system using a [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) with
a [**EuiContextMenu**](#/navigation/context-menu).

<!-- TODO: Add comment event actions example -->

## A comment system

The below example uses a list of **EuiComments**, a [**EuiMarkdownEditor**](#/editors-syntax/markdown-editor),
and a [**EuiMarkdownFormat**](#/editors-syntax/markdown-format) to create a simple comment system.

* Each comment renders in a **EuiComment**.
* We use the **EuiMarkdownEditor** to post the `EuiComment.children`. This means the content uses Markdown.
* When the new **EuiComment** is posted, we use the **EuiMarkdownFormat** to wrap the `EuiComment.children`
  and render the Markdown correctly.

When dealing with asynchronous events like posting a message we recommend setting the **EuiMarkdownEditor** to
a `readOnly` state and the "Add comment" **EuiButton** to a `isLoading` state. This will ensure users understand
that the content cannot be changed while the comment is being submitted.
