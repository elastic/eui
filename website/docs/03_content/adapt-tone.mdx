Adapt the way you write to each situation users can face. 

 Our products and solutions are very technical, data-oriented, and they're used globally by people from different cultures, abilities, and personalities. 
 These considerations, amongst others, limit the spectrum of tones we use to some extent, but not entirely. 
 
 During the users' journey with Elastic, there are times for excitement and discovery, but also times for help, support, and empathy.
