- Updated `EuiTable`, `EuiBasicTable`, and `EuiInMemoryTable` with a new `responsiveBreakpoint` prop, which allows customizing the point at which the table collapses into a mobile-friendly view with cards
- Updated `EuiProvider`'s `componentDefaults` prop to allow configuring `EuiTable.responsiveBreakpoint`

**Deprecations**

- Deprecated the `responsive` prop from `EuiTable`, `EuiBasicTable`, and `EuiInMemoryTable`. Use the new `responsiveBreakpoint` prop instead
- `EuiTable` mobile headers no longer render in the DOM when not visible (previously rendered with `display: none`). This may affect DOM testing assertions.
