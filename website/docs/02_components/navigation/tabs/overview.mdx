Use tabs to organize **in-page** navigation, segmenting mutually-exclusive content under a single
organizational principle. For more guideline usage see
[NNG's article "Tabs, Used Right"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/).

**EuiTabs** is a wrapping component that requires **EuiTab** components as direct children.
You control the displayed contents and current state through props on EuiTab like `isSelected` and `onClick`.

Use the `prepend` and `append` tab props to add content before and after the tab label respectively.

## Tab sizes

**EuiTabs** allow a `size` prop. In general you should always use the default (medium) size. The small size is best
for when placing inside popovers or other small containers. Reserve using the large size for when using as primary
page navigation, like inside of [**EuiPageHeader**](#/layout/page-header).

You can also use the `expand` prop to evenly stretch each tab horizontally.

## Bottom border

The `bottomBorder` helps to separate the tab group from the content below and is on by default.
However, some components like [flyouts](#/layout/flyout) already provide borders which can act as the divider.
In this case you can turn the border off with `bottomBorder={false}`.

## Tabbed content

**EuiTabbedContent** makes it easier to associate tabs with content based on the selected tab.
Use the `initialSelectedTab` prop to specify which tab to initially select.

## Controlled tabbed content

You can also use the `selectedTab` and `onTabClick` props to take complete control over tab selection.
This can be useful if you want to change tabs based on user interaction with another part of the UI.
