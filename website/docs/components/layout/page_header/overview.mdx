While the **EuiPageHeader** component can be placed anywhere within your page layout, we recommend using it within
the [**EuiPageTemplate**](#/templates/page-template) component by passing the configuration props as its `pageHeader`.

**EuiPageHeader** provides props for opinionated, consistent formatting of your header.
Any combination of `pageTitle`, `description`, `tabs`, or any `children` will adjust the layout as needed.

An additional prop `rightSideItems` allows for a simple **array of nodes** which will layout in a flexbox row.
This is commonly used for adding multiple buttons, of which, at least one should be primary (adding `fill="true"`).
These items are also displayed in **reverse order** so that the first and primary array item will be displayed
on the far right.

You can further adjust the display of these content types with an optional `iconType` placed to the left of the title,
`alignItems` for adjusting the vertical alignment of the two sides, and `responsiveOrder` to determine which content
side to display first on smaller screens.


## Tabs in the page header

A set of `tabs` can be displayed inside the page header by passing an array of [**EuiTab**](#/navigation/tabs) objects
using the `label` key for the tab content. When displaying tabs, the `bottomBorder` prop will be enforced to create
separation of the header and content. You'll still need to manage the page content and selected
tab in your own instance.

When supplying `tabs` without a `pageTitle`, **EuiPageHeader** will promote those tabs as if they are the page title.
This means that any `description` or `children` will sit **below** the tabs and should used to describe
the currently selected tab.

## Breadcrumbs in the page header

[Breadcrumbs](#/navigation/breadcrumbs) are useful for tracking in-page flows that **are not part of the entire
application architecture**. To make this easy **EuiPageHeader** provides a `breadcrumbs` prop that accepts
the same configuration as `EuiBreadrumbs.breadcrumbs`.

A common pattern is to use a single breadcrumb to return the user to a listing page from which the current
page was navigated to.

## Customizing the page header

The page header content props are helpful props to push content into established Elastic page layout patterns.
They are completely optional and by design, inflexible. If you need a layout that does not match these patterns
you can pass in your own `children` utilizing the **EuiPageHeaderSection** components.
