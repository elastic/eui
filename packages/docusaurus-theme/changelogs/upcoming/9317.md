- Added `demoFiles` prop to the `Demo` component. It allows to pass extra files that will be added to the Codesandbox instance.
- Updated the `IMPORT_REGEX` to include relative imports so that all imports are removed from the snippet. All references have to be provided through `Demo` prop called `scope`.
