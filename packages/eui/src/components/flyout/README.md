# EUI Flyout System

## Core Flyout Components

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.tsx`
The main flyout component that serves as the entry point for all flyout functionality. It intelligently renders different flyout types based on context:
- **Session flyouts**: When `session={true}` or within an active session, renders `EuiFlyoutMain`
- **Child flyouts**: When within a managed flyout context, renders `EuiFlyoutChild`
- **Standard flyouts**: Default behavior renders `EuiFlyoutComponent`
- **Resizable flyouts**: `EuiFlyoutResizable` component exists but is not integrated into main routing logic

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.component.tsx`
The core flyout implementation with comprehensive functionality:
- **Props**: Extensive configuration options including size, padding, positioning, focus management
- **Types**: Support for `push` and `overlay` types, left/right sides, various sizes (s/m/l)
- **Accessibility**: Built-in screen reader support, focus trapping, keyboard navigation with sophisticated ESC key handling
- **Styling**: Dynamic width handling, responsive behavior, theme integration
- **Portal/Overlay**: Conditional portal rendering and overlay mask management
- **Session Logic**: Complex routing logic that determines flyout type based on session state and managed context
- **Responsive Behavior**: Adaptive layout switching for managed flyouts based on viewport width and flyout size combinations

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.styles.ts`
Contains the emotion-based styling for the flyout component, including:
- Base flyout styles
- Size-specific styles (s/m/l)
- Padding size variations
- Push vs overlay type styles
- Side-specific positioning (left/right)
- Animation and transition styles

## Flyout Management System

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout_manager.tsx`
The central state management system for flyout sessions:
- **Context Provider**: `EuiFlyoutManager` provides global flyout state
- **Session Management**: Tracks main and child flyout relationships with complex state transitions
- **State Reducer**: Handles flyout lifecycle (add, close, set active, set width)
- **Hooks**: Provides utilities like `useIsSessionActive`, `useCurrentSession`, `useFlyoutWidth`
- **Actions**: `addFlyout`, `closeFlyout`, `setActiveFlyout`, `setFlyoutWidth`
- **Responsive Layout**: `useFlyoutLayoutMode` hook manages responsive behavior for managed flyouts with 90% viewport width rule for switching between `side-by-side` and `stacked` layouts

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout_main.tsx`
Renders the primary flyout in a session. Currently a simple wrapper around `EuiManagedFlyout` with `level="main"`. TODO items include handling child flyout presence and adjusting focus/shadow behavior.

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout_child.tsx`
Renders child flyouts within a session:
- **Positioning**: Automatically positions relative to main flyout width
- **Styling**: Supports `backgroundStyle` prop for default/shaded backgrounds
- **Constraints**: Forces `type="overlay"` and `ownFocus={false}`
- **Width Integration**: Uses main flyout width for positioning

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout_managed.tsx`
The managed flyout wrapper that integrates with the flyout manager system, handling registration and lifecycle management. Includes size validation for managed flyouts according to business rules.

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout_validation.ts`
Validation utilities for flyout size business rules:
- **Named Size Validation**: Managed flyouts must use named sizes (s, m, l)
- **Size Combination Rules**: Parent and child can't both be 'm', parent can't be 'l' with child
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for invalid configurations

### `src/components/flyout/manager/index.ts`
Exports all manager-related components and utilities for easy importing.

## Specialized Flyout Components

### `src/components/flyout/flyout_resizable.tsx`
A resizable flyout variant that adds drag-to-resize functionality:
- **Drag Resize**: Mouse/touch drag to resize flyout width
- **Keyboard Resize**: Arrow key navigation for accessibility
- **Constraints**: Configurable min/max width with window bounds checking
- **Callbacks**: `onResize` callback for width change notifications
- **Visual Indicator**: Resize handle with border indicator
- **Note**: Not yet integrated into main flyout routing logic

### `src/components/flyout/flyout_menu.tsx`
A specialized flyout component for menu-style content:
- **Layout**: Flex-based header with back button, popover, title, and close button
- **Context Integration**: Uses `EuiFlyoutMenuContext` for close handling
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- **Styling**: Custom menu-specific styling via `flyout_menu.styles.ts`

### `src/components/flyout/flyout_menu_context.ts`
React context for flyout menu components, providing `onClose` callback to child components.

## Styling and Theming

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.styles.ts`
Core flyout styling with emotion CSS-in-JS:
- Responsive design patterns
- Theme variable integration
- Animation and transition styles
- Size and positioning utilities

### `src/components/flyout/flyout_menu.styles.ts`
Menu-specific styling for the flyout menu component.

### `src/components/flyout/manager/flyout.styles.ts`
Managed flyout styling, including background styles for child flyouts.

## Testing and Documentation

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.spec.tsx`
Unit tests for the main flyout component functionality.

### `src/components/flyout/flyout.test.tsx`
Additional test coverage for flyout behavior and edge cases.

### `src/components/flyout/flyout_menu.stories.tsx`

## Integration

### `src/components/flyout/index.ts`
Main export file that exposes all public flyout APIs:
- Core components: `EuiFlyout`, `EuiFlyoutComponent`
- Body/Header/Footer components
- Resizable and menu variants
- Animation utilities

### `src/components/provider/provider.tsx`
The EUI provider that includes `EuiFlyoutManager` in its component tree, ensuring flyout management is available throughout the application.

- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper cleanup and memory management
- **Size Validation**: Business rule enforcement for flyout size combinations and managed flyout constraints

## TODOs

### Performance Issues

- **Excessive Re-renders**: The flyout manager reducer creates new arrays on every action, causing unnecessary re-renders for all flyout components
- **Unmemoized Style Calculations**: The `cssStyles` array in `flyout.component.tsx` is recalculated on every render without memoization
- **Memory Leaks**: `document.activeElement` is stored in a ref but never cleaned up, potentially causing memory leaks
- **Inefficient DOM Queries**: Focus trap selectors query the DOM on every render without caching

### Accessibility Issues

- **Focus Trap Edge Cases**: The focus trap logic with shards could fail if DOM elements are removed or changed during flyout lifecycle
- **Missing Error Recovery**: No fallback behavior when focus management fails
- **Inconsistent Keyboard Navigation**: Different flyout types may have different keyboard behavior patterns

### Architectural Concerns

- **Tight Coupling**: The flyout system is tightly coupled to the provider system, making it difficult to use standalone
- **State Management Complexity**: The session management system has complex state transitions that could lead to inconsistent UI states
- **Missing Error Boundaries**: No error handling for flyout rendering failures or state corruption
- **Unclear Session Logic**: The complex session routing logic in `flyout.tsx` (lines 40-50) is difficult to understand and maintain
- **Incomplete Integration**: Resizable flyout functionality exists but is not integrated into main routing logic
- **Missing Cleanup**: Focus references and event listeners are not properly cleaned up

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Memoize Style Calculations**: Use `useMemo` for the `cssStyles` array to prevent unnecessary recalculations
2. **Add Error Boundaries**: Wrap flyout components in error boundaries to handle rendering failures gracefully
3. **Improve Type Safety**: Replace `any` types with proper type guards and add comprehensive prop validation
4. **Optimize State Updates**: Use immutable update patterns that minimize re-renders in the manager
5. **Add Cleanup Logic**: Properly clean up focus references and event listeners in useEffect cleanup functions
6. **Simplify Session Logic**: Break down the complex session routing logic into smaller, testable functions
7. **Integrate Resizable Flyouts**: Complete the integration of resizable flyout functionality into the main routing logic
8. **Add Comprehensive Testing**: Add unit tests for complex state transitions and edge cases
9. **Improve Documentation**: Add inline documentation for complex logic and state management patterns
10. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring for flyout rendering and state updates
