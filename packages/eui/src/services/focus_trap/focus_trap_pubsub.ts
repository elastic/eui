/**
 * A lightweight, global PubSub service for loose coupling of components
 * that need to interact with the same focus trap.
 *
 * This allows a component (like `EuiPopover`) to be rendered in a React Portal
 * and still be included in the focus trap of another component (like `EuiFlyout`)
 * without either component needing a direct reference to the other.
 *
 * How it works:
 *
 * 1. A container component (e.g., `EuiFlyout`) `subscribe`s to this service on mount.
 * 2. An ephemeral component (e.g., `EuiPopover`) calls `publish` when its state
 *    changes in a way that affects the DOM (e.g., opening, closing, unmounting).
 * 3. The container component's subscribed callback fires, causing it to re-query
 *    the DOM for any elements it should include in its focus trap.
