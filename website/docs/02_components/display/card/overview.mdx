**EuiCard** is a content-oriented component built on top of [**EuiPanel**](#/layout/panel).
Be sure to check out the [guidelines for properly nesting panels](#/layout/panel/guidelines).

## Basic card

At its core an **EuiCard** should contain a `title`,`description`, and an `icon`.
You can make the whole card clickable by giving it an `onClick` handler or `href`.

For accessibility and heading hierarchy, a card's title element is a `span` by default.
However, this can be changed via the `titleElement` prop without altering the visual size.

## Layout

Most of the time, cards should read from top to bottom (vertical). However, in some cases, you may want the icon
to be to the left of the content. In this case, add the prop `layout="horizontal"`.
Works best when the icon is size `xl`.

:::danger

Horizontal layouts **do not** work with images, footers, or `textAlign`. Therefore, these properties will be ignored.

## Images

Images can be added in place of, or in conjunction with, icons. Just pass an url into the `image` prop,
and it will expand to the edges of the card.

:::note

Make sure that all images are the **same proportions** when used in a singular row.

Also, when passing an **element** to the `image` prop that consists solely of inline elements
or does not contain an`<img />` element, each element will require a style of `width: 100%`.

## Footer

Footers can contain any number of elements and will always align to the bottom of the card.
However, if you supply a footer containing a **EuiButton** you **must not** also give it an `onClick`.

:::warning

When using footers to display generic "Go" buttons, you must provide an `aria-label` to the button itself
that refers back to the title of the card.

## Beta badge

If the card links to or references a module that is not GA (beta, lab, etc.), you can add a `betaBadgeProps.label`
and `betaBadgeProps.tooltipContent` to the card, and it will properly create and position an **EuiBetaBadge**.
If you want to change the title of the tooltip, supply a `betaBadgeProps.title` prop.

<!-- TODO: Add beta badge example -->

## Selectable

When you have a list of cards that can be selected but **do not navigate anywhere**, you can add the `selectable` prop.
The prop is an object that extends **EuiButtonEmpty**. It will apply the button as seen below,
and passing `selectable.isSelected=true` will alter the styles of the card and button to look selected.

:::warning

When providing an extra link to more details or such, be sure to stop event propagation from also selecting the card.

:::

<!-- TODO: Add selectable example -->

## Checkable

**EuiCheckableCard** wraps an **EuiRadio** or **EuiCheckbox** with a more-prominent panel,
allowing for children to be displayed.

:::warning

When used as a radio group, you must provide a `fieldset` with a `legend` for accessibility.

:::

<!-- TODO: Add checkable example -->

## Custom children

In the event that you need **more than** just paragraph text for the `description`, you can supplement with anything
you need as the `children` of the component. You can also completely replace the description with custom children,
but **EuiCard** at least one of these.

<!-- TODO: Add custom children example -->

## Plain and other colors

If you need a card with no borders or shadows pass `display="plain"`. This is a good option to avoid nested panels.
Adding an interaction to the card will provide the clickable styling on hover. The `display` prop also accepts all
other **EuiPanel** colors like `'transparent'`.

For non-interactive cards, reduce or eliminate the padding as needed to suit your layout with the prop `paddingSize`.
