**EuiPanel** is a building block component. Use it as a layout helper for containing content.
It is also commonly used as a base for other larger components like [**EuiPage**](#/templates/page-template),
[**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) and [**EuiCard**](#/display/card).

## Padding

The most basic use is to simply add padding around your content.

## Shadow and border

**EuiPanel** can give depth to your container with `hasShadow` while `hasBorder` can add containment.
Just be sure not to include too many [nested panels](#/layout/panel/guidelines) with these settings.

:::warning

Certain allowed combinations of shadow, border, and color depend on the current theme.

For instance, only plain or transparent panels can have a border and/or shadow.
The default theme doesn't allow combining the `hasBorder` option with `hasShadow`.

## Colors and corners

Use `color` to add background shading to your panel and provide an additional helpful aesthetic
to your container in context. Be mindful to use color sparingly. You can also remove the rounded corners
depending on the placement of your panel with `borderRadius="none"`

Passing `color="transparent"` can give you a quick empty box simply for adding padding to all sides.

## Growing height

Using **EuiPanel** in an [**EuiFlexItem**](#/layout/flex#panels-grow-to-fill-flex-items) will always grow
its height to match. This is great for rows of panels. However, you can also turn this feature off
by setting `grow={false}`.

## Split panels

**EuiSplitPanel** is a composition of an outer and multiple inner **EuiPanels**. It is a namespaced component
that you consume using `EuiSplitPanel.Outer` and `EuiSplitPanel.Inner` respectively. You can supply the same panel
props to both components with the exception of a few to ensure the visual layout is correct.
It also has two directions, `column` (default) and `row`.

For custom responsiveness, you can adjust at which breakpoints a `row` layout will stack by passing
a new array of breakpoint names `['xs', 's']` to the `responsive` prop, or completely turn it off with `false`.
