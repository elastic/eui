# Tables

Tables can get complicated very fast. EUI provides both opinionated and non-opinionated ways to build tables.

- **Opinionated high-level components:**
  - These high-level components remove the need to worry about constructing individual building blocks together. You simply arrange your data in the format it asks for.
  - [**EuiBasicTable**](./basic) handles mobile row selection, row actions, row expansion, and mobile UX out of the box with relatively simple-to-use APIs. It is best used with asynchronous data, or static datasets that do not need pagination/sorting.
  - [**EuiInMemoryTable**](./in-memory) has all the features that EuiBasicTable has, and additionally handles pagination, sorting, and searching the passed data out-of-the-box with relatively minimal APIs. It is best used with smaller synchronous datasets.
- **Non-opinionated building blocks:**
  - If your table requires completely custom behavior, you can use individual building block components like [EuiTable, EuiTableRow, EuiTableRowCell, and more](./custom) to do what you need.
  - Please note that if you go this route, you must handle your own data management as well as table accessibility and mobile UX.
