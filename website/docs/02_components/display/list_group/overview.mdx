The **EuiListGroup** component is used to present **EuiListGroupItems** in a neatly formatted list.
Use the `flush` and `bordered` properties for full-width and bordered presentations, respectively.

Adjust the `gutterSize` prop to increase or decrease the spacing between items.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## List of links

Display **EuiListGroupItems** as links by providing an `href` value and change their state with
the `isActive` and `isDisabled` properties.

If your link is external or will open in a new tab, you can manually set the `external` property.
However, just like with the [**EuiLink**](#/navigation/link) component, setting `target="_blank"` defaults to `external={true}`.

As is done in this example, the **EuiListGroup** component can also accept an array of items
via the `listItems` property.

## Secondary link actions

The `extraAction` property adds a secondary icon button to any list item. It accepts several properties
of its own, including `color`, `onClick`, `iconType`, and `alwaysShow`, and can be used for actions
such as pinning, favoriting, or deleting an item.

## Text wrapping and tooltips

Optional props `showToolTip` and `wrapLines` can be used to augment the display of list items.
Use these when lists are inside small containers where it is likely that the content will be truncated.

Similarly, `toolTipText` can be used to provide tooltip text.
By default, the tooltip will have the text same as the `label`.

You can also use `toolTipProps` to customize tooltip placement, title, and other behaviors.

## List item color and size

**EuiListGroupItems** will get by default the color `text`. You can enforce a different color of `primary`, `text`,
or `subdued` with the `color` prop. Or provide the prop directly to **EuiListGroup**.

They also accept options for text size; `'xs' | 's' | 'm' | 'l'`.

<!-- TODO: Add list item color and size example -->

## Pinnable list group

**EuiPinnableListGroup** is simply an extra wrapper around an [**EuiListGroup**](#/display/list-group)
that provides visual indicators for **pinning**.

Pinning is the concept that users can click a pin icon and add it to a subset of links
(most likely shown in different list group). By providing an `onPinClick` handler, the component will automatically
add the pin action to the item. However, the consuming application must manage the `listItems`and their `pinned` state.

In order to get the full benefit of using **EuiPinnableListGroup**, the component only supports providing
list items via the `listItem` prop and does not support `children`.
