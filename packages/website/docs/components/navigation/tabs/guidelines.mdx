## Do

Follow best practices. Use tabs to organize in-page content. Each tab should contain a segment of information relevant to the current subject. For more UX tips see [NNG's article "Tabs, Used Right"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/).

## Do

For tabs showing primary page content, use the `href` prop to change the current URL hash. Ensure the tab selection is persisted in the user's navigation history and works with the browser's back button.

## Do

Ensure when a page is loaded with a URL hash representing a selected tab (as applied by the `href` prop), that the corresponding tab is shown using the `selectedTab` prop.

## Don't

Apply the `href` prop to change the current page URL hash on more than one set of tabs per page, or non-primary content.

## Don't

Keep users on the same page visually, but change the higher-level navigation logically. Tabs should keep users at the same place within an application. Breadcrumbs and main navigation should not change. The URL hash is the only thing that should change.
