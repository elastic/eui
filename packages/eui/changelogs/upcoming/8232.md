- Updated `EuiProvider` and `EuiThemeProvider` with a new `highContrastMode`
  - This prop allows toggling a higher contrast visual style that primarily affects borders and shadows
  - On `EuiProvider`, if the `highContrastMode` prop is not passed, this setting will inherit from the user's OS/system settings
  - If the user is using a forced colors mode (e.g. Windows' high contrast themes), this system setting will take precedence over any `highContrastMode` or `colorMode` props passed
