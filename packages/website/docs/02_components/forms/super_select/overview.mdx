:::note Not sure which selection component to use?

See [EUI's in-depth guide to selection components](https://github.com/elastic/eui/discussions/7049)
for more information.

:::

This is a simple replacement component for **EuiSelect** if you need more customization in either the display
of the input or option. Simply pass an array of option objects:

* `value`: for storing unique value of item,
* `inputDisplay`: what shows inside the form input when selected,
* `dropdownDisplay`: (optional) what shows for the item in the dropdown

… and the component will create a select styled button that triggers a popover of selectable items.

## More complex

Both `inputDisplay` and `dropdownDisplay` accept React nodes. Therefore you can pass some descriptions with each
option to show in the dropdown. If your options will most likely be multi-line, add the `hasDividers` prop
to show borders between options.

A `placeholder` prop may also be passed that accepts string as well as React nodes
(to match your `inputDisplay` if necessary). This placeholder will only show when `valueOfSelected` is empty.

## States

You can pass the same props as you normally would to **EuiSelect** like disabled, isLoading, compressed, etc…
