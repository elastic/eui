A modal works best for focusing users' attention on a **short** amount of content and getting them to make a decision.
Use it to temporarily interrupt a userâ€™s current task and block interactions to the content below it.

If your modal content is more complex, or requires considerable time to complete,
consider using an [**EuiFlyout**](#/layout/flyout) instead.

ExamplesGuidelines

Each **EuiModal** requires a specific set of nested child components.
They can be omitted if necessary, but the order cannot be changed or interrupted.

Modals come a wrapping **EuiOverlayMask** to obscure the content beneath, but unlike [flyouts](#/layout/flyout),
modals cannot be dismissed by clicking on the overlay mask. This is inline with
our [modal usage guidelines](#/layout/modal/guidelines) which requires there to be a primary action button,
even if that button simply closes the modal.

## Forms in a modal

Since the child components of **EuiModal** are required to be in a specific order, you can only wrap the contents
within **EuiModalBody** with the `<form />` element. You can then hook up your submit button inside **EuiModalFooter**
by adding the `id` of the `<form />` element to the `form` prop of the button.

## Confirm modal

Use the **EuiConfirmModal** to ask the user to confirm a decision. It is a contextual wrapper around **EuiModal**
that provides some helpful props for filling in common modal pieces. By default, the button color indicates a positive
or neutral action. Change the `buttonColor` property to `danger` to indicate a destructive action.

## Loading and disabling confirm button

**EuiConfirmModal** supports being able to apply loading and disabled states to the confirm button
with the `confirmButtonDisabled` and `isLoading` props respectively. This is helpful to indicate the fetching
of data and/or to wait for a user's input before enabling the confirm action.

## Widths

Modals start with a minimum width of `400px`, just enough to display form rows. They will grow to fit the contents
until it reaches the specified `maxWidth`, the default of which is set to the medium breakpoint.

If the modal is not growing wide enough to fit your contents, you can pass a specific `style.width`,
just remember that modals will always shrink to fit the window width.
