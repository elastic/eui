Use loading indicators sparingly and opt for showing actual [progress](#/display/progress#progress-with-values)
over infinite spinners. It is ok to use multiple loaders on a page if each section is progressively loaded.
However, if the entire page is loaded at once, use a single, larger loading indicator.

## Elastic

The **EuiLoadingElastic** loader is great for full page or Elastic product loading screens.

<!-- TODO: Add Elastic logo example -->

## Logos

**EuiLoadingLogo** accepts any of our [**EuiIcon**](#/display/icons#elastic-logos) logos.
It should only be used in very large panels, like fullscreen pages.

## Chart

To indicate that a visualization is loading, use **EuiLoadingChart**.
The multicolor version should be used sparingly, and only when a single large visualization is being loaded.

<!-- TODO: Add chart example -->

## Spinner

**EuiLoadingSpinner** is a simple spinner for most loading contexts.
