- Added the `component` prop to `EuiModalHeaderTitle`, which allows overriding the default `h1` tag
- Added the `titleProps` prop to `EuiConfirmModal`, which allows overriding the default `h1` tag

**Breaking changes**

- `EuiModalHeaderTitle` now **always** wraps its children in a `h1` tag (previously attempted to conditionally detect whether its children were raw strings or not). To change this tag type to, e.g. a more generic `div`, use  the new `component` prop.
