**Breaking changes**

- EuiDataGrid's custom grid body (rendered via `renderCustomGridBody`) no longer automatically renders the column header row or footer rows. It instead now passes the `headerRow` and `footerRow` React elements, which require manual rendering.
  - This change was made to allow consumers to sync header/footer rows with their own custom virtualization libraries.
  - To facilitate this, a `gridWidth` prop is now also passed to custom grid body renderers.
