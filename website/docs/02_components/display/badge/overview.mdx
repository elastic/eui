**EuiBadges** are used to focus on important bits of information. Although they will automatically space themselves
if you use them in a repetitive fashion it is good form to wrap them using a **EuiBadgeGroup** so that they will
wrap when width is constrained (as seen below).

## Badge with Icon

Badges can use icons on the left and right (default) sides.

<!-- TODO: Add icon example -->

## Badge with onClick events

Badges can have `onClick` events applied to the badge itself or the icon within the badge. The latter option is useful for when you might use badges in other components (like a tag system with autocomplete where you need close events).

:::note

`onClick` with `iconOnClick`

When providing both these click handlers, **EuiBadge** must alter the contents so that it does not contain nested button tags. Please make note that if you provide props other than those explicit to **EuiBadge**, they will always be applied to the main `button` tag which may be inside of the outer most tag.

## Badge for health status

Badges can work as health status indicators in places where there are a lot of repeated statuses, e.g. in tables.

## Badge with href

Badges can also be made to render anchor tags by passing an `href`.

<!-- TODO: Add href example -->

## Badge groups and truncation

Badges, like buttons, will only every be a single line of text. This means text will not wrap, but be truncated if the badge's width reaches that of its parent's.

For this reason, badges also auto-apply the inner text of the badge to the `title` attribute of the element to provide default browser tooltips with the full badge text.

To ensure proper wrapping, truncation and spacing of multiple badges, it is advisable to wrap them in a **EuiBadgeGroup**.

## Beta badge type

The **EuiBetaBadge** was created specifically to call out modules that are not in GA. Generally the labels used are "Beta" or "Lab". They require an extra `tooltipContent` to describe the purpose of the badge. You can pass an optional `title` prop to populate the tooltip title or html title attribute but by default it will use the `label`.

If you pass in an `iconType`, only the icon will be used in the badge itself and the label will be applied as the title. Only use an icon when attaching the beta badge to small components. Beta badges can also be made clickable by passing `href` or `onClick` as needed.

They can also be used in conjunction with [**EuiCards**](#/display/card) and [**EuiKeyPadMenuItems**](#/navigation/key-pad-menu).

## Notification badge type

Used to showcase the number of notifications, alerts, or hidden selections. This badge type is commonly used in the [**EuiHeader**](#/layout/header) and [**EuiFilterButton**](#/forms/filter-group) components.
