## Simple and unstyled

**EuiAccordion** has been purposely designed with minimal styles, allowing you to visually enhance it as needed
(see the accordion form example). The only styling enforced by EUI is the caret icon, which indicates to users
that the item can be opened.

A `buttonContent` prop defines the content of the clickable area. On click it will expose the children
and animate based on the height of those children.

For styling needs, classes can be individually applied with `className` (for the entire accordion),
and `buttonClassName` (for the clickable area).

## Arrow display

The arrow helps indicate the current state of the accordion (open or not) and points to the main triggering
button text. If you must hide or change the side in which the arrow appears, use `arrowDisplay: 'right'` or `'none'`

## Multiple accordions

Use any number of **EuiAccordion** elements to visually display them as a group.

Due to the previously mentioned bare styles, it is recommended to place an [**EuiSpacer**](#/layout/spacer) between
accordion items. Padding within each accordion item can be applied via the `paddingSize` prop.

## Extra actions

Use the `extraAction` prop to pass an extra action displayed on the right of any accordion. Usually this is a delete
or button, but can be anything. Note that this action is separate from the click state that expands the accordion.
This is needed to make it accessible.

## Opened on initial render

Use the `initialIsOpen` prop to open the accordion when first rendered.

## Controlling toggled state

Typically, the open and closed state of **EuiAccordion** is maintained by the component's internal state.
Though, you can manually control it with:

*   `forceState`: Accepts either `'open'` or `'closed'`.
*   `onToggle`: A callback function returning `true` if the accordion is open

## Loading state

Use the `isLoading` prop when not all of the accordion's content is ready yet.
When using `isLoading`, the content of `extraAction` is replaced with a loading spinner.

Manage the content of the accordion using `isLoadingMessage`. By default, it is set to `false` and the content
will remain unaltered. Set it to `true` to show a default loading message or pass a node to show
a custom loading message.

## Disabled state

In some cases you might want to prevent the user from closing the **EuiAccordion**. For example, if a form field
is displaying an error, opening the accordion and preventing its closure until the error has been addressed
will help the user find and fix the error.

The `isDisabled` prop will disable interaction on the button and the arrow. Use it in conjunction
with `initialIsOpen` to achieve the desired effect.

:::warning

When disabling the interaction of accordions based on user input, it's advisable to ensure there is further explanation
through the use of help or error text.

:::

## When content changes dynamically

If an accordionâ€™s content changes height while the accordion is open, it will resize dynamically.

## Interactive content in the trigger

Passing interactive content like links, buttons, or form elements as the `buttonContent`,
will cause issues with the wrapping button element. To fix this, you can change this wrapping element
to a div using `buttonElement="div"`.

If you don't want the interactive content to trigger the accordion expansion,
you will have to apply `e.stopPropagation()` to your element manually.

:::warning

Accordions need a focusable button for accessibility, so changing the element to anything other than a button will enforce the display of the arrow.

## Styled for forms

Accordions are unstyled by default, but **EuiAccordion** supports several props around padding sizes and borders,
as well as letting you pass in your own custom CSS styles. See the snippet tab below for a quick preview of said props,
and the and the demo code tab below for custom hover and focus CSS overrides.

We also recommend creating a fieldset/legend combination for better accessibility and DOM structure by passing
`element="fieldset"`. This will set the entire accordion as a `<fieldset>` and automatically change
the `buttonElement` to a `<legend>`.
