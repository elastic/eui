# Image

Use **EuiImage** when you need to place a static image into a page with an optional caption.

:::tip Writing meaningful image alt text

This page has several examples of alt text written to aid screen reader users, as well as several examples of when _not_ to include alt text. When an image is decorative, or if the image is adequately described by surrounding text, it is better to pass an empty `""` string instead.

When an image is not already sufficiently described, the alt text passed should help non-visual users understand the purpose of the image within the context of the overall page. See [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) for a more detailed guide to writing effective alt text.

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import { EuiImage } from '@elastic/eui';

export default () => (
  <EuiImage
    size="l"
    hasShadow
    caption={
      <p>
        <em>Mastigias papua</em>, also known as spotted jelly
      </p>
    }
    alt="Many small white-spotted pink jellyfish floating in a dark aquarium"

  />
);
```

## Click an image for a fullscreen version

Apply the `allowFullScreen` prop to make the image clickable and show a fullscreen version. Note that the second image also passes `fullScreenIconColor="dark"` to change icon color to better contrast against the light background of that image.

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import { EuiImage, EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiLink } from '@elastic/eui';

export default () => (
  <EuiFlexGroup justifyContent="spaceEvenly">
    <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
      <EuiImage
        size="m"
        hasShadow
        allowFullScreen
        caption="Albert Einstein, theoretical physicist"
        alt="" // Because this image is sufficiently described by its caption, there is no need to repeat it via alt text
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg"
      />
    </EuiFlexItem>
    <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
      <EuiImage
        allowFullScreen
        caption={
          <>
            Browser usage on{' '}
            <EuiLink
              href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimedia_browser_share_pie_chart.png"
              target="_blank"
            >
              Wikimedia (CC BY 3.0)
            </EuiLink>
          </>
        }
        alt="Pie chart describing browser usage on Wikimedia on October 2011. Internet Explorer occupies 34 percent, Firefox occupies 23 percent, Chrome occupies 20 percent, Safari occupies 11 percent, Opera occupies 5%, Android occupies 1.9 percent, and other browsers occupy 3.5 percent."
        src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Wikimedia_browser_share_pie_chart.png"
        fullScreenIconColor="dark"
        size={300}
        style={{ padding: '20px 30px', background: 'white' }}
      />
    </EuiFlexItem>
  </EuiFlexGroup>
);
```

## Images can be sized

Images can be sized by passing the `size` prop a value of `s / m / l / xl / original / fullWidth / number / string`. This size sets the **maximum** length of the longest edge of the image, whether that is height or width, and scales it. Only the provided sizing values will also increase the size of a smaller image.

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import { EuiImage, EuiSpacer } from '@elastic/eui';

const src =
  'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1477747219299-60f95c811fef?w=1000&h=1000&fit=crop&q=60';
const alt =
  'A cozy breakfast scene. In the background is a plate of waffles and blueberries. In the middle ground is a glass of orange juice and a small cup of cream. In the foreground is a plate of Eggs Benedict with a side of salad and cherry tomatoes.';

export default () => (
  <div>
    <EuiImage
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      size={50}
      caption="Custom size (50)"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
      wrapperProps={{ className: 'eui-textLeft' }}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      size="s"
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Small"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      size="m"
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Medium"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      size="l"
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Large"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      size="xl"
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Extra large"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Original"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
    <EuiSpacer />
    <EuiImage
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      size="fullWidth"
      caption="Full width"
      alt={alt}
      src={src}
    />
  </div>
);
```

## Supporting SVG images

If you are using an SVG source within `EuiImage`, the SVG image may not show up! While this is surprising to the user, if your image doesn't have a width or viewbox set, it is behaving in accordance with the SVG spec.

In order to work with an SVG image that lacks a defined size, you'll want to set a `size` prop. If you are using the `allowFullScreen` prop as well, you will also want to add a `width` prop.

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import { EuiImage } from '@elastic/eui';

export default () => (
  <EuiImage
    size="l"
    width={600}
    hasShadow
    caption="Diagram of fishapod timelines"
    alt="Diagram of fishapod timelines"
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Fishapods.svg"
    allowFullScreen
  />
);
```

## Float images within text

When using `EuiImage` within `EuiText` it is often useful to apply floats. Almost always you'll want to pair the `float` prop usage, with a `margin` prop usage to give space around your image. Margins, when used in combo with floats, will adjust depending upon the position of the float.

:::warning Be careful with floats

Floats should only be used on images within **large** bodies of text. Specifically, we only suggest using them with `EuiText` which comes automatically clears floats.

:::

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import { EuiImage, EuiText } from '@elastic/eui';
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';

export default () => (
  <EuiText>
    <EuiImage
      size="l"
      float="right"
      margin="l"
      hasShadow
      caption="A randomized image"
      allowFullScreen
      alt="" // Because the image is randomized, there is no meaningful alt text we can generate here.
      src="https://picsum.photos/800/500"
    />
    <p>{faker.lorem.paragraphs()}</p>
    <p>{faker.lorem.paragraphs()}</p>
    <p>{faker.lorem.paragraphs()}</p>
    <EuiImage
      size="l"
      float="left"
      margin="l"
      hasShadow
      allowFullScreen
      caption="Another randomized image"
      alt="" // Because the image is randomized, there is no meaningful alt text we can generate here.
      src="https://picsum.photos/300/300"
    />
    <p>{faker.lorem.paragraphs()}</p>
    <p>{faker.lorem.paragraphs()}</p>
  </EuiText>
);
```
