These guidelines are intended for all content authors, whether you are a developer, a designer or a writer. 
This page shares common tips and tricks for writing accessible content. 
It is not exhaustive and does not replace the official
[WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#guidelines).


Content is only a part of Web accessibility. Check the
[EUI documentation](https://eui.elastic.co/#/guidelines/accessibility) for more general
accessibility guidelines.


## What is accessible content and why does it matter

**Accessibility** for content means making sure that the content, all of it, can be consumed properly, independently of how users choose or have to interact with it.

Our users and readers are diverse, with different abilities, and disabilities. 
They also interact with our content in different ways: screen readers, mobile devices, Braille, and so on. The list is long, and always evolving. 

As content authors, it is our responsibility to provide them with [perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust content](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head).

## Guidelines

✔️ **Make your content quickly scannable.** A clear structure and meaningful words will tell users if the content is relevant to them within seconds. Use unique headings.

✔️ **Add alt text for all images, icons and media files.** Screen readers, Braille output devices, and search engines will love concise, accurate alt text that describe what cannot always be displayed, viewed or heard on screen. 

✔️ **Use plain language.** Users read our content to perform their tasks. Jargon and complex sentences will confuse them or, at best, slow them down. Expand acronyms when first written. Very helpful, detailed plain language guidance can be found on the [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) website.

✔️ **Use meaninglful link text.** Descriptive text instead of "click here", "read more", or even a raw URL for a link makes it easier for users to understand what to expect when they'll open it. Screen
readers jump between links by generating a list of them, and spell out URLs.

✔️ **Use device agnostic language.** Users can access content and products in many ways. We do not know if they use a mouse, a keyboard, a tablet, and so on. 

✔️ **Avoid directional language.** Above, below, left, right, and so on. All these terms assume that the layout never varies and that users actually see it, and that they see it the way you think they do. What about disabilities or responsiveness?
