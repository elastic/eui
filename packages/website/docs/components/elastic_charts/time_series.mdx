# Time series

External library: @elastic/charts v64.1.0

Time series charts show data over a period of time, such as trends or comparisons across multiple categories. When smaller changes exist, itâ€™s better to use line charts rather than bar charts.

**Key configurations**

*   `BarSeries.xScaleType = "time"`
*   `tickFormat = timeFormatter(niceTimeFormatByDay(1));`
