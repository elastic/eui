EUI provides different types of basic form controls: [**EuiFieldText**](#/forms/form-controls#text-field),
[**EuiFieldSearch**](#/forms/form-controls#search-field), [**EuiFieldNumber**](#/forms/form-controls#number-field),
[**EuiFieldPassword**](#/forms/form-controls#password-field), [**EuiSelect**](#/forms/form-controls#select),
[**EuiTextArea**](#/forms/form-controls#textarea), and [**EuiFilePicker**](#/forms/form-controls#file-picker).

:::warning

Wrap each of your from controls in a **EuiFormRow**

Use the [**EuiFormRow**](#/forms/form-layouts#form-and-form-rows) component to easily associate form components with
labels, help text, and error text. For accessibility, you must provide a `label`, `aria-label` ,
or a text node ID of an external label to the `aria-labelledby` prop.

:::

## Text field

This component renders a basic HTML `<input type="text">` element.
Use a **EuiFieldText** to allow users to enter or edit text.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFieldText example -->

## Search field

This component renders a basic HTML `<input type="search">` element.
Use a **EuiFieldSearch** to allow users to enter search queries.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFieldSearch example -->

## Number field

This component renders a basic HTML `<input type="number">` element.
Use a **EuiFieldNumber** to allow users to enter numbers.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFieldNumber example -->

## Password field

Use a **EuiFieldPassword** to allow users to enter a password.
By default, it renders a basic HTML `<input type="password">` where the content is obfuscated.
When users type in the field the characters are presented as asterisks.

You can change this default behavior by passing `type="dual"` so that users can toggle between showing
and obfuscating the content. This option makes the experience more user-friendly and accessible.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFieldPassword example -->

## Select

This component renders a basic HTML `<select>` element. Use **EuiSelect** to allow users to choose from
a list of 7 to 12 options. When there are less than 7 options consider using
a [**EuiRadioGroup**](#/forms/selection-controls#radio-group).

If you need more customization for searching or rendering options,
see [EUI's guide on selection components](https://github.com/elastic/eui/discussions/7049).

<!-- TODO: add EuiSelect example -->

## Textarea

This component renders a basic HTML `<textarea />` element.
Use **EuiTextArea** to allow users to enter multi-line text.

<!-- TODO: add EuiTextArea example -->

## File picker

**EuiFilePicker** is a stylized, but generic HTML `<input type="file">` tag. It supports drag and drop as well
as on click style selection of files. The example below shows how to grab the files using the
[FileList API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList).
Like other form elements, you can wrap it in a **EuiFormRow** to apply a label.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFilePicker example -->

### Removing files programmatically

The current file selection can be cleared programmatically by calling the `removeFiles` method, which can be accessed
on a component instance via React `ref`: `filePickerRef.current.removeFiles()`.

<!-- TODO: add EuiFilePicker removeFiles() example -->

## Prepend and Append

Most form controls accept a `prepend` and `append` prop that allows passing a single node/string
or an array of nodes/strings. Strings will be converted into form labels and connected to the input
via `htmlFor` for accessibility.

These are great for demarcating the input's metric like "px" or "ms". You can also pass buttons for input settings
or additional filters. Just be sure to use`<EuiButtonEmpty size="xs" />`.

<!-- TODO: add prepend and append examples -->

## Form control layout

<Badge color="warning">Building block only</Badge>
<br /><br />

**EuiFormControlLayout** is generally used internally to consistently style form controls,
but itâ€™s published in case you want to create your own form control which matches those of EUI.
The examples below demonstrate its various states and utilize the `controlOnly` and `type` props
of **EuiFieldText** as the wrapped control.

:::warning Additional padding required

The padding on the `input` itself doesn't take into account the presence of the various icons supported
by **EuiFormControlLayout**. Any input component provided to **EuiFormControlLayout** is responsible
for its own padding.

## Form control layout delimited

<Badge color="warning">Building block only</Badge>
<br /><br />

Like **EuiFormControlLayout**, **EuiFormControlLayoutDelimited** is generally used internally to consistently
style form controls. This component specifically lays out two form controls with center text or icon.

It takes all of the same props as **EuiFormControlLayout** except for `children`. Instead, it requires both
a **single** `startControl` and a **single** `endControl`. You can optionally change the center content
to a different string or node (like an EuiIcon).
