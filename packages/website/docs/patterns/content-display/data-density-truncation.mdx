# Data density & truncation

*This pattern page is coming soon. It will document data density and truncation best practices and provide ready-to-copy examples.*

## When to use

- **High-density data** that needs to fit in limited space
- **Long text content** that needs truncation
- **Responsive layouts** that require content adaptation
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets

## When not to use

- **Critical information** that should never be truncated
- **User-generated content** that needs full visibility

## Composition

Built from atoms:
- `EuiText` (with truncation props)
- `EuiToolTip` (for truncated content)
- `EuiPopover` (for expandable content)
- `EuiButtonEmpty` (for "show more" actions)

## Variants

- **Text truncation** - Long text with ellipsis
- **Tooltip expansion** - Hover to see full content
- **Expandable content** - Click to expand truncated text
- **Responsive density** - Adaptive content based on screen size

## Examples

*Examples will be added here with interactive code blocks.*
