**EuiSelectable** aims to make the pattern of a selectable list (with or without search) consistent
across implementations. It is the same concept used in [**EuiComboBox**](#/forms/combo-box)
and [**EuiFilterGroup**](#/forms/filter-group).
**This is not intended for [primary navigation](#/display/list-group)** but can be used to simplify the construction
of popover navigational menus; i.e. the spaces menu in the [header](#/layout/header).
See [EUI's in-depth guide on which selection component to use](https://github.com/elastic/eui/discussions/7049)
for more information.

## The basics

At its simplest, **EuiSelectable** requires an array of `options` and an `onChange` handler which passes back
the altered `selectedOptions` array. The `children` is a function that return the `list` and `search` nodes.

:::note

Selected options are based on the checked = on property

**EuiSelectable** offers the ability to **exclude** selections or **include selections for some** (mixed).
Therefore, the `checked` property is one of `undefined | 'on' | 'off' | 'mixed'`, `'on'` being the default
for selected options when `allowExclusions = false`.

## Searchable

To add a search component to the list, simply add the `searchable` prop. You can optionally pass
in a `searchProps` object which will get passed down to the actual **EuiFieldSearch** used.
In this example,`onSearch` will return a second parameter, enabling you to access the list of filtered items

:::note

The search is performed as a string match against the `option.label`
unless a separate `option.searchableLabel` is provided.

## Single selection

Selection can be restricted to a single option at a time with the `singleSelection` prop.
Passing `true` allows for 0 or 1 option to be selected, while `"always"` requires 1 option to be selected at all times.
The default value is `false`.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Options can be excluded

Adding `allowExclusions` allows cycling through the checked options (on -> off -> undefined).

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Options can be mixed (indeterminate)

Setting an option to `checked: “mixed”` allows showing an indeterminate/mixed state.
This state can only be set by the consuming application, and should typically be used to show that another state
being controlled by the **EuiSelectable** has some, but not all, items selected.

When clicking a mixed option, the option will cycle to "on", and after that cycle between on -> off
(if `allowExclusions` is true) -> undefined). Users cannot manually cycle back to mixed.

## Messages and loading

The component comes with pre-composed messages for loading, empty, and no search result states.
To display your own messages, pass `loadingMessage`, `emptyMessage`, `errorMessage`,
or `noMatchesMessage` respectively. Alternatively, you can replace the entire `list` display with your own message
for any state. In which case, we recommend wrapping your custom message in an **EuiSelectableMessage** component.

## Sizing and containers

The component's children, `list, search`, are returned via the `children` function, which means you can wrap
the individual elements in anything you want.

### Width and height

The width has been made to always be 100% of its container, including stretching the search input.
When used inside of [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover), we recommend setting a width (or min/max values) via CSS
on the element containing the list to avoid expansion and contraction.
By default, the height is capped at showing up to 7.5 items. It shows half of the last one to help indicate
that there are more options to scroll to. To stretch the box to fill its container, pass 'full' to the `height` prop.

### Flexbox

Be aware that `display: flex` with column layout is applied to the wrapping container.
This is so that you can opt in to allow the height of the list stretch to fill its container.
See the flyout example.

## Truncation

**EuiSelectable** defaults to `listProps.textWrap="truncate"`, which truncates long option text
at the end of the string.

You can use `listProps.truncationProps` and almost any prop that [**EuiTextTruncate**](#/utilities/text-truncation)
accepts to configure this behavior. This can be configured at the **EuiSelectable** level,
as well as by each individual option.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Rendering the options

There are two object properties you can add to enhance the content of your options, `option.prepend`
and `option.append`. These will add nodes before and after the option label respectively.
They will not be included in the searchable content as this only matches against the label property.

### Selection icons

You can choose not to display the check and cross icons indicating selection by setting `listProps.showIcons`
to false. This is useful for instances that navigate elsewhere on selection or hide their selected options
from the list.

### Group labels

An option is allowed to be passed that is just a header for the options that follow it.
It takes no mouse handlers and renders similar to a title.
Add one of these by setting the `option.isGroupLabel` to true.

### Row height and virtualization

When virtualization is on, **every row must be the same height** in order for the list to know
how to scroll to the selected or highlighted option. It applies the `listProps.rowHeight` (in pixels)
directly to each option hiding any overflow.

If `listProps.isVirtualized` is set to `false`, each row will fit its contents and removes all scrolling.
Therefore, we recommend having a large enough container to accommodate all options. You can also remove truncation
by setting `textWrap="wrap"` when virtualization is off.

### Custom content

While it is best to stick to the `option.label, option.append, option.prepend` and `listProps.showIcons` props,
you can pass a custom `renderOption` function which will pass back the single `option` object and the `searchValue`
to use for highlighting.

To provide data that can be used by the `renderOption` function that does not match the standard option API,
use `option.data` which will make custom data available in the `option` parameter. See the `secondaryContent`
configuration in the following example.

Also, if your custom content is taller than the default `listProps.rowHeight` of `32px` tall,
you will need to pass in a custom value to this prop.
