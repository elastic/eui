- `EuiFlyout`s now automatically shard all fixed `EuiHeader`s on the page. This means that interactions (mouse & keyboard) with items inside `EuiHeader`s when flyouts are open will no longer trigger focus fighting
- `EuiFlyout`s now read out detailed screen reader dialog instructions and hints on open

**Breaking changes**

- Removed the ability to customize the `role` prop of `EuiFlyout`s. `EuiFlyout`s should always be dialog roles for screen reader consistency.
- Removed `closeButtonAriaLabel` prop from `EuiFlyout` - use `closeButtonProps['aria-label']` instead
