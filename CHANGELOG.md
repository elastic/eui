EUI's changelogs are too numerous to view in a single file, and have been split up by year. Ways to view them:

- In the [changelogs](./changelogs) folder as raw markdown files
- On our [docs website](https://eui.elastic.co/#/package/changelog) as rich text
- [Searching for individual release](https://github.com/elastic/eui/releases) changelogs
