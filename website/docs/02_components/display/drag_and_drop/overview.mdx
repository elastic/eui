An extension of [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) (which is an actively maintained fork
of [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)) with a compatible API and built-in
style opinions. Functionality results from 3 components working together:

* `<EuiDragDropContext />`: Section of your application containing the draggable elements and the drop targets.
* `<EuiDroppable />`: Area into which items can be dropped. Contains one or more `<EuiDraggable />`.
* `<EuiDraggable />`: Items that can be dragged. Must be part of an `<EuiDroppable />`

:::warning Consider your users, use case

Drag and drop interfaces are not well-adapted to many cases, and may be less suitable than other form types
for data operations. For instance, drag and drop interaction relies heavily on spatial orientation that may
not be entirely valid to all users (e.g., screen readers as the sole source of information).
Similarly, users navigating by keyboard may not be afforded nuanced, dual-axis drag item manipulation.

EUI (largely due to the great work already in @hello-pangea/dnd) has and will continue to ensure accessibility
where possible. With that in mind, keep your users' working context in mind.

## Just the facts

**EuiDraggable** makes very few assumptions about what content it contains. To give affordance to draggable elements
and to ensure a consistent experience, child elements must be able to accept a border and drop shadow
(automatically applied via CSS). No other style opinions are applied, however.

Similarly, **EuiDroppable** must accept a background color overlay (automatically applied via CSS),
but has no other restrictions.

All **EuiDragDropContext** elements are discrete and isolated; **EuiDroppables** and **EuiDraggables** cannot
be shared/transferred between instances. Also, **EuiDragDropContexts** cannot be nested. It is recommended that
a single, high-level **EuiDragDropContext** is used and **EuiDroppables** account for categorical and functional
separation (see later examples).

**EuiDragDropContext** handles all events but makes no assumptions about the result of a drop event.
As such, the following event handlers are available:

* `onBeforeDragStart`
* `onDragStart`
* `onDragUpdate`
* `onDragEnd` (required)

EUI also provides methods for helping to deal to common action types:

* `reorder`: change an item's location in a droppable area
* `copy`: create a duplicate of an item in a different droppable area
* `move`: move an item to a different droppable area

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Simple item reorder

The simplest case, demonstrating a single **EuiDroppable** with `reorder` behavior.

Notice the ability to change rendered content based on dragging state. **EuiDraggable** `children` is a render prop
that mush return a `ReactElement`. The `snapshot` parameter on that function has state data that can be used
to alter appearance or behavior (e.g., `isDragging`).

<!-- TODO: Add reorder example -->

## Custom drag handle

By default, the entire element surface can initiate a drag. To specify an element within as the handle and create
a containing group, set `customDragHandle=true` and `hasInteractiveChildren=true` on the **EuiDraggable**.

The `provided` parameter on the **EuiDraggable** `children` render prop has all data required for functionality.
Along with the `customDragHandle` flag,`provided.dragHandleProps` needs to be added to the intended handle element.

<!-- TODO: Add custom drag handle example -->

:::note

**Icon-only** custom drag handles require an accessible label. Add an `aria-label="Drag handle"` attribute
to your React component or HTML element that receives`provided.dragHandleProps`.

:::

## Interactive elements

**EuiDraggable** can contain interactive elements such as buttons and form fields. Interactive elements require
`customDragHandle=true` and `hasInteractiveChildren=true` on the **EuiDraggable**. These props will maintain drag
functionality and accessibility, while enabling click, keypress, etc., events on the interactive child elements.

<!-- TODO: Add interactive elements example -->

## Move between lists

By default, all **EuiDroppable** elements are of the same type and will accept **EuiDraggable** elements from
others in the same **EuiDragDropContext**.

The EUI `move` method is demonstrated in this example.

<!-- TODO: Add move between lists example -->

## Distinguish droppable areas by type

Setting the `type` prop on an **EuiDroppable** element will ensure that it will only accept **EuiDraggable** elements
from the same type of **EuiDroppable**.

Notice that the enabled, compatible **EuiDroppable** elements have a visual change that indicates they can accept
the actively moving/focused **EuiDraggable** element.

<!-- TODO: Add distinguish by type example -->

## Copyable items

For cases where collections of **EuiDraggable** elements are static or can be used in multiple places set
`cloneDraggables=true` on the parent **EuiDroppable**. The **EuiDroppable** becomes disabled (does not accept
new **EuiDraggable** elements) in this scenario to avoid mixed content intentions.

The EUI `copy` method is available and demonstrated in the example below. Note that the data point used
as `draggableId` in **EuiDraggable** must change to allow for real duplication.

`isRemovable` is used in the example for cloned items. This API is likely to change, but currently provides
the visual changes with drop-to-remove interactions.

<!-- TODO: Add copyable items example -->

## Kitchen sink

**EuiDraggables** in **EuiDroppables**, **EuiDroppables** in **EuiDraggables**, custom drag handles, horizontal
movement, vertical movement, flexbox, panel inception, you name it.

<!-- TODO: Add kitchen sink example -->

## Using drag and drop in popovers

**EuiDraggables** use fixed positioning to render and animate the item being dragged.
This positioning logic does not work as expected when used inside of containers that have their own
[stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context).

This behavior particularly affects [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover). If using drag and drop UX within a popover,
you **must** include the `<EuiPopover hasDragDrop>` prop for items to properly render while being dragged.

<!-- TODO: Add drag and drop in popover example -->
