The **EuiHealth** component should be used when showing comparative health of listed objects (like servers,
HTTP response status codes (as per convenience), nodes, indexes, etc.). Because icons are vague and bulky
and color alone does not work, color plus text provides a recognizable, lightweight combo that works
in most situations.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Text sizes

Match the text size of **EuiHealth** to your context by passing `xs / s / m / inherit` to the `textSize` prop.
The `inherit` style will get its font size from the parent element.
