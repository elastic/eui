**Accessibility**

- `EuiDataGrid`'s keyboard/screenreader experience has been tweaked to be more consistent for varying complex data:
  - Headers are now always navigable by arrow key, regardless of whether the header cells contain interactive content
  - Non-expandable cells containing any amount of interactive content now must be entered via Enter or F2 keypress
  - Expandable cells continue to be toggled via Enter or F2 keypress
- `EuiDataGrid` now provides a direct screen reader hint for Enter key behavior for expandable & interactive cells
