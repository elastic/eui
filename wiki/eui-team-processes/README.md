# Elastic EUI team docs

This wiki section is primarily intended to document processes or decisions that only Elastic EUI team members will have to perform. It tends to contain very nitty-gritty, step-by-step, documentation of how to perform specific developer responsibilities or chores.

If you're a developer new to the EUI team (welcome!), I recommend starting with the [Contributing to EUI](../contributing-to-eui/) wiki docs first, as those docs apply to all developers - community/open-source devs and Elastic devs alike.
