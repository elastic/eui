Use the **EuiExpression** component to surface expressions. It requires both a `description` (left side)
and `value` (right side). Optionally, you can pass it an `onClick` function that will convert it to a button
and add some additional styling to indicate that it is clickable.

## Colors

You can pass a `color` prop but it will only color the `description`.

## Stringing a bunch together

If the expression is more than one description and value, you can string multiple expressions together,
and they should inline together and wrap at logical points.

## Column display

There might be cases where displaying multiple **EuiExpression**s in a paragraph is not ideal.
For example, when both the `description` and the `value` are variable or when their text is quite long.
To use a column display instead, pass `display="columns"`.

In column display, each expression is its own line and the `description` column is aligned to the right.
The default width for the `description` is 20%, but you can customize this with the`descriptionWidth` prop.
When displaying a group of **EuiExpression**s, make sure to set the same width for all descriptions.

## Invalid state

Set `isInvalid` to true to display **EuiExpression**'s error state.
This state will override the `color` prop with danger.

<!-- TODO: Add example -->

## Truncate text

To truncate **EuiExpression**'s content, pass `textWrap="truncate"`.
Text truncation only works properly if the prop types of `description` and `value` are strings.
If you're using nodes, use the `.eui-textTruncate` utility class on all their sub-children.
