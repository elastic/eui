The **EuiKeyPadMenu** component presents **EuiKeyPadMenuItems** in a tiled format,
with a fixed width which will accommodate three items and then wrap.

**EuiKeyPadMenu** is just a wrapping element for creating the list elements but you must declare
each **EuiKeyPadMenu** component manually.

If the menu provides navigation for your application, wrap the **EuiKeyPadMenu**
with `<nav aria-label="Nav title"></nav>`.

## Menu item

The **EuiKeyPadMenuItem** component can act both as an anchor as well as a button by specifying
`href` or `onClick` respectively. It requires a text-based `label` and `children` for declaring
the [icon](#/display/icons). This is the most flexible way for handling the customization of the icon itself.

When using the `isSelected` prop to create a toggle button, you must supply both the `true` and `false`
states explicitly to ensure the attribute is added for both states.

## Beta item

If the item links to a module that is not GA (beta, lab, etc), you can add a `betaBadgeLabel`
and `betaBadgeTooltipContent` to the card and it will properly create and position
an [**EuiBetaBadge**](#/display/badge#beta-badge-type).

Supplying just a label will only show the first letter in the badge but displays the full label to the tooltip.
You can also pass an `iconType` to replace the letter.

## Checkable

**EuiKeyPadMenuItem**s can also be rendered as checkbox or radio form controls using the `checkable` prop.
Pass in `"multi"` for checkboxes or `"single"` for radios.

To ensure the **EuiKeyPadMenu** renders the semantically appropriate HTML elements, you will need to pass
in the `checkable` prop as `true` or an object that requires a `legend`. This will wrap the input group
in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`.

For single selection (radio) items, you must pass a singular `name` prop to each item to ensure
they are grouped properly. Also, if you would like to hide the visible `<legend>` in favor of an screen-reader
only solution, you can pass `ariaLegend` instead of `legend`.
