## Filter buttons

Use **EuiFilterGroup** to wrap **EuiFilterButtons** into a container that looks nice against form fields (like search).
These buttons are used in two different patterns. The most simplest use is that of an on/off pattern to show whether
a filter is on. Add the prop `withNext` to remove the border between it and the next EuiFilterButton
to visually group similar or opposite style filters.

Set `hasActiveFilters` to true when the filter is active.

## Multi-select

To provide a long list of grouped filters, we recommend wrapping the filter button within
an [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) and passing the items to a searchable [**EuiSelectable**](#/forms/selectable).

### Indicating number of filters

By passing a number to `numFilters` you can express the number of filters available.
When the user has applied these filter add the prop `hasActiveFilters` as before and this will change
the coloring of the indicator. You can also supply a number to `numActiveFilters` which will change
the number displayed.

## Layout

By default, the bar is auto-widthed based on its contents. To expand the bar to fill its parent's width
add `fullWidth`. This will also set each button to grow. If you do not want the button to grow, set `grow=false`.
