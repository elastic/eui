## Installation

EUI is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elastic/eui) as a dependency. To install EUI into an existing project, use the `yarn` CLI (`npm` is not supported).

```bash
yarn add @elastic/eui
```

Note that EUI has [several `peerDependencies` requirements](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/package.json) that will also need to be installed when starting with a blank project.

```bash
yarn add @elastic/eui @elastic/datemath @emotion/react @emotion/css moment
```

You can read more about other ways to [consume EUI](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/consuming-eui/) in our wiki.

## Setting up your application

EUI uses CSS-in-JS (specifically [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)) for its styles and theming. As such, we require an `<EuiProvider>` wrapper around your application in order for various theme-related UI & UX (such as dark/light mode switching) to work as expected.

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { EuiProvider, EuiText } from '@elastic/eui';

const MyApp = () => (
  <EuiProvider>
    <EuiText><p>Hello World!</p></EuiText>
  </EuiProvider>
);

export default MyApp;
```

For more configuration options of the provider, see the [**EuiProvider** documentation](/docs/utilities/provider).

## Styling your application

You can build custom components using EUI's theme tokens, consumed via `useEuiTheme()`. The below example uses Emotion's `css` prop, but any CSS-in-JS library should be able to interpolate the JS variables.

For more ways to consume EUI's theme, see the [**EuiThemeProvider** documentation](/theming/theme-provider#consuming-with-the-react-hook).

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { EuiIcon, EuiCode, EuiText, useEuiTheme } from '@elastic/eui';
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

export default () => {
  const { euiTheme } = useEuiTheme();
  return (
    <EuiText>
      <p>
        <EuiIcon
          type="stopFilled"
          size="xxl"
          css={{ color: euiTheme.colors.primary }}
        />{' '}
        This primary color will adjust based on the light or dark theme value
      </p>

      <p
        css={css`
          background: ${euiTheme.colors.lightShade};
          padding: calc(${euiTheme.size.base} * 2);
        `}
      >
        The padding of this box is created using <EuiCode>calc()</EuiCode>{' '}
        because EUI&apos;s theme sizes are string pixel values that are
        calculated off the theme&apos;s <EuiCode>base</EuiCode>
      </p>
    </EuiText>
  );
};
```

### Customizing with classes

For consumers using vanilla or preprocessed CSS, all components allow you to pass a custom `className` prop, which will be appended onto the component.

:::warning Avoid overwriting `.eui` class names

EUI's class names are not a guaranteed API and are prone to change, which will risk breaking your theme. Target your custom classNames instead.

:::

While EUI's styles are generally low in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**specificity**</a> due to our usage of CSS-in-JS, you may need to ensure that your CSS is defined after ours in your `<head>`. See [**EuiProvider's** cache customization for more style injection options](../utilities/provider.mdx#emotioncache-customization).

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { EuiButton } from '@elastic/eui';
const myCustomCSS = `
  .myCustomButton {
    background-color: pink;
  }
`;
export default () => (
  <>
    <style>{myCustomCSS}</style>
    <EuiButton className="myCustomButton">Hello world!</EuiButton>
  </>
);
```

### Customizing the style tokens

EUI can be slightly customized to fit your branding needs by altering the base tokens like color and typography. You can pass a full or partial list of override tokens to the **EuiProvider**'s `modify` prop.

:::warning Touch the least amount of variables possible

By nature, EUI is very rigid. You shouldn't need much to make drastic changes to color. Most themes are less then a dozen variable overwrites in total.

:::

For a full list of global tokens visit [Customizing theme](/docs/theming/customizing-themes). For more examples of the `modify` prop, see the [**EuiThemeProvider** docs](/theming/theme-provider#simple-instance-overrides).

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { EuiCode, EuiText, EuiThemeProvider, useEuiTheme } from '@elastic/eui';

const Box: FunctionComponent<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const { euiTheme } = useEuiTheme();

  return (
    <EuiText
      css={{
        background: euiTheme.colors.lightShade,
        padding: euiTheme.size.xl,
      }}
    >
      <p>{children}</p>
    </EuiText>
  );
};

export default () => {
  const overrides = {
    colors: {
      LIGHT: { lightShade: '#d3e6df' },
      DARK: { lightShade: '#394c4b' },
    },
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <EuiThemeProvider modify={overrides}>
        <Box>
          The background of this box is using the locally overridden value of{' '}
          <EuiCode>euiTheme.colors.lightShade</EuiCode>
        </Box>
      </EuiThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Fonts

By default, EUI ships with a font stack that includes some outside, open source fonts. If your system is internet available you can include these by adding the following imports to your SCSS/CSS files, otherwise you'll need to bundle the physical fonts in your build. EUI will drop to System Fonts (which you may prefer) in their absence.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Roboto+Mono:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Or grab all weights, including italics, between 400 and 700 as a variable font.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:slnt,wght@-10,300..700;0,300..700&family=Roboto+Mono:ital,wght@0,400..700;1,400..700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

### Embedding with `@font-face`

If your application doesn't allow grabbing the font assets from a CDN, you'll need to download and locally provide the font files. You can download the files directly from their source site [rsms.me/inter/](https://rsms.me/inter/), then follow the instructions in the provided CSS file for importing. We recommend using the single variable font file and importing with the following settings:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-weight: 300 900;
  font-display: swap;
  font-style: oblique 0deg 10deg;
  src: url("Inter.var.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

## Components, Services and Testing imports

You can import React components from the top-level EUI module.

```tsx
import {
  EuiButton,
  EuiCallOut,
  EuiPanel,
} from '@elastic/eui';
```

Most services are published from the `lib/services` directory. Some are published from their module directories in this directory.

```tsx
import { keys } from '@elastic/eui/lib/services';
import { Timer } from '@elastic/eui/lib/services/time';
```

Test utilities are published from the `lib/test` directory.

```tsx
import { findTestSubject } from '@elastic/eui/lib/test'; // Enzyme
import { findByTestSubject, render, screen } from '@elastic/eui/lib/test/rtl'; // React Testing Library
```

## Customizing component defaults

While all props can be individually customized via props, some components can have their default props customized globally via **EuiProvider's** `componentDefaults` API. [Read more in EuiProvider's documentation](../utilities/provider.mdx#component-defaults).

```tsx
<EuiProvider
  componentDefaults={{
    EuiTable: { responsiveBreakpoint: 's', },
    EuiTablePagination: { itemsPerPage: 20, },
    EuiFocusTrap: { crossFrame: true },
    EuiPortal: { insert },
  }}
>
  <App />
</EuiProvider>
```
