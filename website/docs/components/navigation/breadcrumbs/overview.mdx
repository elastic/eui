**EuiBreadcrumbs** let the user track their progress within and back out of a UX flow and work well when used
in combination with [**EuiPageHeader**](#/layout/page-header). They are meant to be used at lower page level flows,
while [**EuiHeaderBreadcrumbs**](#/layout/header) should be used for application-wide navigation.

**EuiBreadcrumbs** requires an array of **EuiBreadcrumb** objects as `breadcrumbs` and handles truncation,
including middle-truncation in the case of many items, and mobile responsiveness. Each item accepts an `href` prop,
though we recommend the last item represent the current page and therefore the link is unnecessary.

:::warning

For accessibility, it is highly recommended to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for each set of breadcrumbs.

:::

## Limit the number of breadcrumbs

Use the `max` prop to collapse breadcrumbs beyond a certain number.
The center breadcrumbs will collapse into a single item allowing the user to navigate these items from within a popover.

## Truncate each breadcrumb

**EuiBreadcrumbs** will truncate the full set by default, forcing it to a single line and setting a max width
on all items except for the last. You can turn this off by setting `truncate={false}`.

Alternatively, you can force truncation on single breadcrumb **item** by adding `truncate: true` to the object.

## Responsive

**EuiBreadcrumbs** are `responsive` by default and will collapse breadcrumbs on narrower screens.
Setting `responsive={false}` will keep all breadcrumbs visible at all screens sizes.

Alternatively, you can change number of breadcrumbs that show per breakpoint by passing a custom responsive object.

## Popover content

If you want a breadcrumb that toggles a popover, e.g. for an account switcher, you can use the `popoverContent` prop
for this purpose. **EuiBreadcrumbs** will automatically handle rendering a popover indicator and popover accessibility
best practies for you. We recommend using components such as [**EuiContextMenu**](#/navigation/context-menu)
or [**EuiListGroup**](#/display/list-group) for displaying popover options,
or potentially [**EuiSelectable**](#/forms/selectable) if you have many items that require filtering.

You may also pass `popoverProps` with almost any prop that [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) accepts,
such as customizing `panelPaddingSize` or `anchorPosition`. However, props that affect popover state
such as `closePopover`, `isOpen`, and `button` are not accepted as they are controlled automatically
by **EuiBreadcrumbs**.

:::warning

Please note that creating a breadcrumb with a popover will nullify any passed `href` or `onClick` behavior,
as the _only_ interaction the breadcrumb should have at that point is the popover toggle.

:::

## Color for emphasis

Each breadcrumb extends the color options from [**EuiLink**](#/navigation/link) when either an `href` or `onClick`
is applied . You can change the default color of a breadcrumb to add emphasis or indicate state like `'danger'`
for an error. However, use caution not to use color alone.

Please also note that link colors cannot be overriden for `type="application"` breadcrumbs.
