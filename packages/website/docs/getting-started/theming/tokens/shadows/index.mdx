# Shadows

There are 5 sizes of shadows. The first level of each shadow enhances contrast and remains consistent across all sizes.

:::info In dark mode, shadows get an additional lighter border, to ensure they are visible
:::

```mdx-code-block
import { ShadowsTable } from './shadows_table';
```

<ShadowsTable />

:::warning Use `xlHover` exclusively as the hover state for size `xl`
:::

## Direction

Shadows can only have two directions, up and down. By default shadows point down.

TODO explain use cases?

<ShadowsTable direction="up" />

## Hover state

Each shadowed surface, when interactive, follows a hover effect rule: it moves up one level. 

- `xs` hovered → `s`
- `s` hovered → `m`
- `m` hovered → `l`
- `l` hovered → `xl`
- `xl` hovered → `xlHover`

TODO simple demo
