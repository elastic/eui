**EuiFlyout** is a fixed position panel that pops in from the side of the window.
It should be used to reveal more detailed contextual information or to provide complex forms without losing
the user's current state. It is a good alternative to [modals](#/layout/modal) when the action is not transient.

Like modals, you control the visibilty of the flyout using your own state management,
but **EuiFlyout** requires an `onClose` handler for it's internal dismiss buttons.

:::note

Use `aria-labelledby={headingId}` to announce the flyout to screen readers.

## More complicated flyout

This component also comes with related child components for ease of creating headers,
footers and scrolling body content. **EuiFlyoutHeader** and **EuiFlyoutFooter** are pinned to the top and bottom
of the flyout, respectively, to allow for always visible navigation and actions. The **EuiFlyoutBody** component
will then automatically overflow.

## Sizing

Flyouts come in three predefined `size`s of `'s' | 'm' | 'l'`, which define the width **relative to the window size**
with a minimum width defined in pixels. You can otherwise supply your own fixed width in number or string format.

## Adjusting padding

All the inner flyout components inherit their padding from the wrapping **EuiFlyout** component.
This ensures that all the horizontal edges line up no matter the `paddingSize`. When using the `"none"` size,
you will need to accommodate your content with some other way of creating distance to the edges of the flyout.

## Adding a banner

To highlight some information at the top of a flyout, you can pass an [**EuiCallOut**](#/display/callout)
to the `banner` prop available in **EuiFlyoutBody** and its layout will adjust appropriately.

## Without ownFocus

Like modals, you will usually want to obscure the page content beneath with `ownFocus` which wraps the flyout
with an [**EuiOverlayMask**](#/utilities/overlay-mask) . However, there are use-cases where flyouts present more
information or controls, but need to maintain the interactions of the page content. By setting `ownFocus={false}`,
the underlying page content will be visible and clickable.

## Push versus overlay

Another way to allow for continued interactions of the page content while a flyout is visible,
is to change the `type` from `overlay` to `push`.

A pushed flyout still positions itself as `fixed`, but adds padding to the document's body element to accommodate
for the flyout's width. Because this squishes the page content, the flyout changes back to `overlay`
at smaller window widths. You can adjust this minimum breakpoint with `pushMinBreakpoint`.

:::warning

Push flyouts require manual accessibility management

Push flyouts do not use a focus trap, do not close on Escape keypress, do not inherit
a [dialog role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role),
and do not include any of the default screen reader guidance that overlay flyouts contain out-of-the-box.

Please be cautious when using push flyouts, and make sure you are managing your own focus and screen reader UX.

## Understanding max-width

By default, flyouts will continue to grow with the width of the window.
To stop this growth at an ideal width, set `maxWidth` to `true`, or pass your own custom size.

:::warning

Note that there are some caveats to providing a maxWidth that is smaller than the minWidth.

## Resizable flyouts

You can use **EuiFlyoutResizable** to render a flyout that users can drag with their mouse or use arrow keys to resize. This may be useful for scenarios where the space the user needs can be unpredictable, if content is dynamic. Resizable flyouts allow users to adjust content to better fit their individual screens and workflows.

We strongly recommend setting reasonable numerical `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props based on the flyout content and page content that you _can_ predict.
