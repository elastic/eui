**EuiText** is a generic catchall wrapper that will apply our standard typography styling and spacing to naked HTML.
Because of its forced style it **only accepts raw XHTML**.

:::note When using **EuiText**, keep in mind:

* All your **XHTML** elements should be direct descendants of **EuiText**.
  You should avoid wrapping them in a `div` or `span`. This will ensure styles are applied correctly.
* Avoid nesting React components which would break their styling.

:::

**EuiText** can ensure proper line-length for readability by setting a `max-width` on the entire component.
To add the max-width setting, set `grow=false`.

## Text can come in various sizes

Using the `size` prop on **EuiText** you can get smaller sizes of text than the default.
This demo compares the scaling for all sizes. The goal is that the every line-height lands on the `4px` baseline grid.

## Coloring text

There are two ways to color text. Either individually by applying **EuiTextColor** on individual text objects,
or by passing the `color` prop directly on **EuiText** for a blanket approach across the entirety of your text.

## Alignment

There are two ways to align text. Either individually by applying **EuiTextAlign** on individual text objects,
or by passing the `textAlign` prop directly on **EuiText** for a blanket approach across the entirety of your text.
