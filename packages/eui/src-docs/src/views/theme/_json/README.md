## Temporary note

NOTE: The `.json` and `.json.d.ts` files in this directory are no longer dynamically generated from various component Sass files, but instead static copies that, over time, should eventually be removed as we migrate from Sass to Emotion.

For JavaScript usage: use `useEuiTheme()` instead to obtain theme variables.

For Sass usage: TBD
