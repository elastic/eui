**EuiSideNav** is a responsive menu system that usually sits on the left side of a page layout.
It will expand to the width of its container. This is the same menu system used for the EUI documentation.

Configure the content of a **EuiSideNav** by passing in an `items` prop. Refer to the source code
for an example of this data structureâ€™s anatomy.

:::note

The responsive behavior converts the list into an accordion style component with a mobile only button.

You will need to pass a string to the prop `mobileTitle` to label the mobile button.

## Side nav heading

Since **EuiSideNav** renders a `<nav>` section element, it is recommended that the element contain a heading.
Pass a string or node to the `heading` prop to display within an `<h2>`. Though you can also adjust this heading
element with `headingProps.element`.

If the heading is visually unnecessary for your application, pass `headingProps.screenReaderOnly` to ensure proper
accessibility for those using assitive technology.

:::note

When providing a heading, this will then be the default display for the mobile button title.

## Complex side nav

**EuiSideNav** also supports multiple top level sections and deeply-nested tree-based data.

We recommend being consistent with the use of the root level item and whether it is used solely for labelling a section.
Intermixing linked and non-linked root items will confuse the user. Stay consistent throughout your entire
application and platform.

## Nested item options

Typically, the children of nested items progressively shows as users traverse the pages themselves.
However, you can bypass this functionality and force open items by setting `items[n].forceOpen = true`.

Arrow indicators will show only if the item has children but **does not** have an interaction itself.
The component will then handle the toggling of the displayed children as well.

## Emphasized side nav sections

Adding the `emphasize = true` prop to a **EuiSideNav** item will enhance the visual appearance of that section
and its nested items. This is helpful for when you need to indicate a dynamic navigational item
like a user-created object.

:::note

Extra style needed

The emphasized nav item's background color extends beyond the horizontal bounds of the component to allow it to reach
it's parents bounds. Be sure to add `overflow: hidden` to whichever container you'd like it to stop at.
