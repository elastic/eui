The **EuiTimeline** component standardizes the way a timeline thread is displayed.
Pass an array of **EuiTimelineItem** objects and **EuiTimeline** will generate a timeline thread.

This component allows you to create any type of timeline, but for more specific use cases you should consider:

* [**EuiSteps**](#/navigation/steps): a timeline that allows you to present instructional content that must
  be conducted in a particular order and might contain progress indications.
* [**EuiCommentList**](#/display/comment-list): a timeline that allows you to display comments or logging
  actions that either a user or a system has performed.

:::warning

For accessibility, it is required to wrap your **EuiTimelineItem**'s with a **EuiTimeline**.
It is highly recommended to provide a descriptive `aria-label`, or a text node ID of an external label
to the `aria-labelledby` prop of the **EuiTimeline**.

## Timeline item

Each **EuiTimelineItem** has two parts: an icon on the left side and an event on the right side.
To create an item you need the following props:

* `icon`: main icon that appears on the left side. Can be passed as any `IconType` string or custom node
  (e.g. [**EuiAvatar**](#/display/avatar)). It is recommended not to use an element larger than 40x40.
* `children`: any node as the event content.

## A timeline thread with multiple items

You can create a timeline thread by rendering multiple **EuiTimelineItem** components in a **EuiTimeline**.
Following this structure ensures that timeline styles are applied correctly and appropriate semantic elements
are used to assist with screen readers.

When passing an `icon` and `children` prop to each item, there are some design considerations to take into account:

* `icon`: use icons of the same size to create a better visual consistency.
* `children`: when your content is just one line of text, the recommendation is to use a [**EuiText**](#/display/text)
  as a wrapper. For multi-line content consider using a [**EuiPanel**](#/layout/panel)
  or a [**EuiSplitPanel**](#/layout/panel#split-panels) instead. For other types of components like editors,
  the recommendation is to pass the children without any wrapper.

The following example shows how to display multiple **EuiTimelineItem**s and how you can use a **EuiSplitPanel**
as the content wrapper.
