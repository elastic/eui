### Summary / Pitch

**Target EUI release date(s)**:
Related request:

<!-- 
Write this like an "elevator pitch". Pretend you're writing it to the CEO, or a user, and you have 10 seconds to describe it.

A sentence or two and a visual work best. Make it super simple and concise. This is not for us, this is for people looking at our Roadmap and want to understand what we're working on.
-->

### Context

<!-- 
Explain the "why". 
Be succinct; more detail will be included in the PRD.
What is the problem we are solving? 
What is the user need or business value?
-->

### Goals

<!-- 
Define acceptance criteria.
Be specific and measurable.
What are we trying to achieve? 

- [ ] Make XYZ better
- [ ] Solve XYZ problem
-->

### Out of scope

<!-- 
Set expectations for others; make it clear if anything major and obvious is not in scope. 

- e.g. Will not include public APIs
- e.g. Error messages coming from elasticsearch will not be localized
-->

<!--
### Milestones

Dates should only be included if this is a private issue.
For internal planning only; dates are not a public commitment to a feature.
You probably don't need this section in a public Epic.
