**Breaking changes**

- The following props are no longer needed by `EuiBasicTable` or `EuiInMemoryTable` for responsive table behavior to work correctly, and can be removed:
  - `isSelectable`
  - `isExpandable`
  - `hasActions`

**DOM changes**

- `EuiTableRow`s rendered by basic and memory tables now only render a `.euiTableRow-isSelectable` className if the selection checkbox is not disabled
