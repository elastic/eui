**Accessibility**

- Improved the accessibility of `EuiColorPicker` by:
  - preventing duplicate color output for screen readers
  - adding tooltips with visual color labels for the selected colors on the saturation and hue sliders
  - updated accessible labels and announcements to be more descriptive
