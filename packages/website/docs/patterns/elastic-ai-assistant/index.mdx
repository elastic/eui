# Elastic AI Assistant Patterns

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

The AI Assistant aids users in navigating complex workflows, providing smart insights, and enhancing interactive experiences across our solutions.


The interaction model with the AI Assistant is bifurcated into two primary components, _contextual insights_ and _chat interface_. Each component provides timely assistance, insights, and a conversational medium for complex inquiries.

These components can live independently, as well as work in tandem, forming an expanded interaction model for the AI Assistant.

## When to use

1. **Complex workflows**: When the product has intricate workflows that users might struggle to navigate.
2. **Data overload**: In environments where users deal with large volumes of data, the AI Assistant can surface the most relevant insights, reducing cognitive load.



## Interaction model

The interaction between the user and the AI Assistant should be fluid, with the ability to transition seamlessly between contextual insights and the chat interface.

#### Insights embedded in the product

Trigger a contextual insight to get contextual, relevant help about the current views youâ€™re interacting with. This appears unobtrusively within the UI, offering explanations, tips, warnings or recommendations.

#### From insights to the Chat interface to keep the generated context

Insights serve as a springboard for deeper interaction with the assistant, via the chat interface. Go from a contextual insight to a chat interface and keep that generated context to continue in a conversational mode with the AI Assistant. During a conversation, the AI Assistant can generate different widgets to help/guide you through a different solution flow, creating a seamless transition and a coherent narrative.

#### Start conversation from scratch

Start a conversation without any preceding context or insight. You can come up with a query or request and engage in a dialogue with the AI Assistant. During the conversation, the AI Assistant can generate different widgets to help and guide you through a different solution flow.
