# Betas

Beta status indicates that a feature is new and/or experimental. These features are not yet considered stable and are likely to change frequently—including potential changes to APIs, behavior, or removal—until they reach general availability (GA). Beta features are made available to gather feedback and evolve based on real-world usage, but they should be adopted with the understanding that breaking changes are possible.
