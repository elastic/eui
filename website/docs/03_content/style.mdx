## General style recommendations

### Spelling 
Use **American English** by default. 

### Conversational voice 

- Use contractions
- Prefer active voice
- Use "We" when you mean Elastic
- Use "You" when you mean the user

### Adverbs

Use adverbs sparingly. If you can omit a word, do it.

## Case

Use **sentence case** by default. This goes for navigation menus, titles and headers, buttons, and so on. 

The only exceptions are proper nouns, [branded terms](https://brand.elastic.co/302f66895/p/194a3b-writing-style-guide/t/159934), and solution names. 

- **Do:** Developer tools
- **Don't:** Developer Tools

## Punctuation

### Exclamation mark

Don't use exclamation marks unless you are sharing an exciting news. And if you are, only use one.

### Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma before the final item in a list.

- **Do:** Elastic's solutions are Elasticsearch, Observability, and Security
- **Don't:** Elastic's solutions are Elasticsearch, Observability and Security

### Periods (full stops)

Don't use periods in headers, titles, placeholders, and navigation labels. Use them to complete description text in the product, messages, and notifications. Don't use them in a bulleted list unless the list item is a complete sentence.

- **Do:** Developer tools
- **Don't:** Developer tools.

## Elastic's voice

The **voice** represents the personality of the product and its main traits.
The following principles define our voice.

### **Real people, writing for real people**

| ✔️ Be...            | How?                                                                        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human, plainspoken | Be conversational, yet professional. Write close to how you'd talk.         |
| Empathetic, caring | Write what matters to users. Use words that you normally use.               |
| Inclusive, open    | Write for all audiences. Don't use terms that might discriminate or offend. |
| User-focused       | Address users directly. Don't abuse possessive markers like "yours".        |

### **Get the user's job done**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timely      | Help users when it's needed. Not everything is critical to describe in more details.    |
| Informative | Ensure all content serves a purpose and is not just decoration.                         |
| Succinct    | Shorten the content to something meaningful and scannable, without sacrificing clarity. |


### **Empowering and authentic**

| ✔️ Be...     | How?                                                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inspiring   | Use words that motivate users and help them progress.                              |
| Confident   | Be definite and trustworthy. Delete unnecessary wording. Don't oversell.           |
| Transparent | Help users connect the dots and see the big picture, while giving them the choice. |
