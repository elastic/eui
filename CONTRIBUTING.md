# Contributing to EUI

ðŸ™Œ Thanks for your interest in contributing to EUI! ðŸ™Œ

## New components, features, and bug fixes

When creating new components, adding new features, or fixing bugs, please refer to the [Component Development guidelines][docs-components]. If there isn't an associated issue on the bug tracker yet, consider creating one so that you get a chance to discuss the changes you have in mind with the rest of the team.

### Feel free to submit pull requests in draft stages

EUI has strict quality and testing standards due to its large downstream footprint and accessibility requirements. Don't feel intimidated and think you need to submit perfect PRs because of this. We welcome draft PRs to show conceptual ideas or enhancements you would like to see. The EUI team normally engages on these PRs in one of two ways, which is largely up to you.
1. We can provide review and guidance for how to get the PR up to the library's standards. (slower, but you might enjoy this)
2. We can commit directly to your PR to get it over the finish line. (faster)

If you have a preference, let us know when you make your PR, but never feel guilty about just handing it off. We're here to help.

### Adding icons

EUI provides an ever-growing set of [icons][icons], but our set can be incomplete. If you find you need an icon that does not exist, create a new issue and tag it with the *icons* label. A designer from the EUI team will respond to discuss your needs.

If you are willing and able to design the icon yourself, then please refer to the [Creating icons][creating-icons] section of the wiki for design guidelines and instructions on creating your pull request.

## Documentation

Always remember to update [documentation site][docs] via the `src-docs` folder and the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) in the same PR that contains functional changes. We do this in tandem to prevent our examples from going out of sync with the actual components. In this sense, treat documentation no differently than how you would treat tests.

Here are our guidelines for updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file:

* Append your changes to the `master` sub-heading of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
* Add a list item for each significant change in the PR: bugs that were fixed, new features, new components, or changes to the public API
* In the list item, always link to any relevant pull requests
* Add a summary of what has changed, making sure it's informative to consumers who might be unaware of implementation details
* Avoid documenting internal implementation changes that don't affect the public interface
* Write your entry in the past tense, starting with a verb (e.g. Added... , Fixed...)
