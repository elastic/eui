  Our general set of do's and don'ts for testing components and views.
</div>

## Choose the right selectors

Follow RTL's [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/)
and [query priorities](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority) when choosing right element selectors.

Prioritize accessible and semantic queries (e.g., `[role="dialog"]`) followed by `data-test-subj` attributes over
other, more complicated and prone to breaking queries (e.g. `div > span.title`) whenever possible.

Check out our component-specific testing docs to find the selectors we officially support.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Use accessible and semantic queries.">
  ```tsx
  screen.getByRole('dialog'); // react-testing-library
  cy.get('[role="dialog"]'); // cypress
  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('[role="dialog"]')); // selenium
  ```
</Guideline>

<Guideline type="dont" panelPadding="none" text="Query by internal EUI selectors, especially when better selectors are available.">
  ```tsx
  container.querySelector('.euiFlyout'); // react-testing-library
  cy.get('.euiFlyout'); // cypress
  driver.findElement(By.cssSelector('.euiFlyout')); // selenium
  ```
</Guideline>

## Don't use snapshots

**The EUI team strongly discourages snapshot testing**, despite its simplicity.
Snapshot tests are prone to frequent failures due to the smallest things, like whitespace changes.
Developers often update stored snapshots when they see them fail without thinking too much about why they fail.

Tests should tell a story and be considered an instant red flag whenever they fail.
They should focus on the important details like the data a component is displaying
or if the data is coming from a prop or being dynamically calculated.

Instead, consider writing simple but precise assertion tests.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Query and assert on elements you actually want to test">
  ```tsx
  const { getByText, getByRole } = render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(getByText('Hello, World!')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Save');
  ```
</Guideline>

<Guideline type="dont" panelPadding="none" text="Snapshot whole components">
  ```tsx
  const { container } = render(<MyComponent />); // react-testing-library
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
  ```
</Guideline>

## Avoid time-based waits

Sometimes the easiest solution to fixing a test is adding a wait/sleep call. In most cases, though,
this can't be considered a reliable fix, because:

1. It significantly increases total test run time, especially when used often
2. Every machine will take a different amount of time to execute the code, and some &mdash; especially CI runners
&mdash; are prone to lag during the test run.

Instead, use the utilities available for every testing framework to wait for elements to appear
or for asynchronous operations to finish execution.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Programmatically await changes to occur">
  ```tsx
  screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save document' });
  expect(await screen.findByText('Document saved successfully')).toBeInTheDocument();
  ```
</Guideline>

<Guideline type="dont" panelPadding="none" text="Add timeouts and other static waits">
  ```tsx
  screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save document' });
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  expect(screen.getByText('Document saved successfully')).toBeInTheDocument();
  ```
</Guideline>

## Write clear test names

Test cases and suites should have unambiguous names and match the naming convention throughout the project.
Use short but descriptive names written in plain English.

We recommend using the third-person singular simple present tense for its short form and ease of reading.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Use clear and consistent names and test grouping">
  ```tsx
  describe('arraySearch()', () => { // use tested function name as the root group name
    it('accepts object arrays', () => { /* [...] */ });
    it('accepts string arrays', () => { /* [...] */ });
    it('throw on non-array inputs', () => { /* [...] */});
    it('supports the `options.caseSensitive` option', () => { /*[...]*/ });
  });
  ```
</Guideline>

<Guideline type="dont" panelPadding="none" text="Use inconsistent or unclear naming">
  ```tsx
  describe('array search', () => { // bad: not pointing to what exactly this group is testing
    it('object arrays', () => { /* [...] */ }); // bad: not enough context
    it('arraySearch(["a", "b"])', () => { /* [...] */ }); // bad: function call example may not be easily understandable
    it('should throw on non-array inputs', () => { /* [...] */ });
    it('supports options.caseSensitive', () => { /* [...] */ }); // bad: using two different naming conventions; see line above
  });
  ```
</Guideline>

### Wrap property names and data in  `` ` ``

When including property and argument names in the test name string, wrap them in backticks (`` ` ``) to clearly
separate them from the rest of the text.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Wrap property names in backticks">
  ```tsx
  it('returns an empty object when the `value` string is empty');
  ```
</Guideline>

<Guideline type="dont" panelPadding="none" text="Have no separation between property names and the rest of the text">
  ```tsx
  it('returns an empty object when the value string is empty');
  ```
</Guideline>

## Add debug-friendly comments or error messages

Consider adding custom error messages or code comments for assertions that are not obvious.
For [jest](https://jestjs.io/), we recommend adding a comment on top or to the right of the assertion,
so in case of an error, it will be printed out together as the failing code fragment.

<Guideline type="do" panelPadding="none" text="Explain the source of the asserted value in code">
  ```tsx
  // Total should equal the result of 1234^2 / 3.14 rounded to two decimal places
  expect(screen.getByText('Total: 484954.14')).toBeInTheDocument();
  ```
</Guideline>
