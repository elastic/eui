## Concepts

- Axis:
X Axis: the orizontal one, the indepedant variable
Y Axis: the vertical one, the dependant variable

Only one X axis. Multiple Y axis.


- Domain:
Related to a dataset, is the extent of one variable, usually one that needs to be used draw the position of the specific datum along one axis (vertical or horizontal).
On a chart, we always needs to have at least two domain, representing the 2 dimensions of the data we are drawing. Multiples domain can coexist (multi axis charts) but they are not suitable to be used to correctly compare data into multiple dimensions (the correctness of the visualization depends on the data preparation).

- Hierarchical/tree domain (only on x axis):
A domain that consist of multiple levels.

- Series Group:
A set of one or more datasets that, theoretically, shares the same domains.
If multiple data series coexist on the same group, their domains are merged together.



- Data series

- Data Preparation:
To correctly draw a 2 dimension dataset, your data needs to be prepared beforehand.
The praparation usually involves:
  - uniformify the data structure: each data point
