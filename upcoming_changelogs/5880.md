**Bug fixes**

- Fixed `EuiContextMenuPanel` (when used within an `EuiPopover`) to correctly return focus to its popover toggle in all scenarios, not just keyboard Escape press

**Breaking changes**

- Removed `watchedItemProps` from `EuiContextMenuPanel`, which now updates like a standard component and no longer needs this logic
