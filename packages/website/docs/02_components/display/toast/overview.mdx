Be sure to read the full [toast usage guidelines](#/guidelines/toast).

## Toast list

<!-- TODO: Add toast list example -->

## Default

**EuiToast** allows for small notes that appear in the bottom right of the screen.
They should be used for ephemeral, live actions (think **save complete** or **something
just finished right now**).

They should not be used for historical actions (**your report built 30 minutes ago**).
This means that a user should never be greeted with toasts when starting a session.
Toasts should be brief and avoid long paragraphs of text or titling.

<!-- TODO: Add default example -->

## Info

For informative messages use `type="info"`.

<!-- TODO: Add info example -->

## Success

For success messages use `color="success"`.

<!-- TODO: Add success example -->

## Warning

Use this callout to warn the user against decisions they might regret. Show a warning message when the program
detects that **something is not behaving right, but it didn't cause any termination.** For warning messages
use `color="warning"`.

<!-- TODO: Add warning example -->

## Danger

Use this callout to let the user know that something went wrong. For example if you want to communicate an error.
You should show an error message when the issue is **terminal, this doesn't always mean that the operation stops
completely, but the task is not complete**. For errors messages use `color="danger"`.
