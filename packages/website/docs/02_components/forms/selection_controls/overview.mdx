EUI provides three types of selection controls: **EuiCheckbox**, **EuiRadio** and **EuiSwitch**.
These controls allow users to select options among a list or switch settings on/off.
They are ideal for a small list of options.

For longer lists of options, consider using a [EuiSelect](#/forms/form-controls#select),
[EuiSuperSelect](#/forms/super-select) or [EuiComboBox](#/forms/combo-box).

## Checkbox

This component renders a basic HTML `<input type="checkbox">` element.
Use checkboxes to allow users to select multiple options from a list.

Use the `checked` prop to handle the checked and unchecked state.
You can also use the `indeterminate` prop to set an indeterminate state.
This state is commonly used in hierarchical checkboxes to indicate that only
some of the checkbox's descendants are checked.

Make sure to pass a `label` to ensure a larger clickable area and ensure that screen readers will read out
the label when the user is focused on the input. To learn more about labels usage,
go to the [guidelines tab](#/forms/selection-controls/guidelines).

## Checkbox group

Use a **EuiCheckboxGroup** when you want to generate a group of checkboxes by passing an array of `options` with
an `id` and`label` for each object. Use the `idToSelectedMap` to indicate the IDs of the selected items.

When the individual labels for each radio do not provide a sufficient description, pass a `legend` to the group.

Use the `compressed` prop to tighten up the spacing between checkbox rows.

## Radio

This component renders a basic HTML `<input type="radio">` element.
Use radio buttons to allow users to choose one option out of a list. They are ideal for a list of more than 2 options,
and usually no more than 6 options.

When creating a list, each input should have the same `name` to ensure a group is established.
This way when you select a radio button in that group, the other options are automatically deselected.

Make sure to pass a `label` to ensure a larger clickable area and ensure that screen readers will read out
the label when the user is focused on the input. To learn more about labels usage,
go to the [guidelines tab](#/forms/selection-controls/guidelines).

<!-- TODO: add EuiRadio example -->

## Radio group

Use a **EuiRadioGroup** when you want to generate a group of radio buttons by passing an array
of `options` with an `id` and`label` for each object. Pass a single `name` property to define the group.

When the individual labels for each radio do not provide a sufficient description, pass a `legend` to the group.

<!-- TODO: add EuiRadioGroup example -->

## Switch

A switch can be substituted for a checkbox when the semantics of the label dictate a true on/off state.

<!-- TODO: add EuiSwitch example -->

Make sure to pass a `label` to ensure a larger clickable area and ensure that screen readers will read out
the label when the user is focused on the input. You can find more about labels usage
in the [guidelines tab](#/forms/selection-controls/guidelines).

If the switch is described in some other manner, like when using
an [**EuiFormRow**](#/forms/form-layouts#form-and-form-rows), you can eliminate the visible label
with `showLabel={false}` or use it to further describe the state.

:::warning

When providing the state as the label, you'll need to provide an aria-describedby with the label's
id to associate it with the switch.

## Fieldset and legend

:::warning

"\[Use a fieldset and legend\] for groups of related controls where the individual labels for each control
do not provide a sufficient description, and an additional group level description is needed."
[WCAG Spec](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H71)

:::

**EuiFormFieldset** simply wraps its children in a `<fieldset>` with the option to add a `<legend>`
via the `legend` object prop. Find more examples in the [guidelines tab](#/forms/selection-controls/guidelines).
