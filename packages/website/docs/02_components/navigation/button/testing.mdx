`<EuiButton>`, `<EuiButtonIcon>` and `<EuiButtonEmpty>` are all rendering native `<button>` or `<a>` elements.

## Buttons as `a` elements

When `<EuiButton>`, `<EuiButtonIcon>` or `<EuiButtonEmpty>` receive a valid `href` property, they will render
an anchor (`<a>`) element instead of a button (`<button>`). Please keep in mind that no matter what element
is used underneath, they'll look the same, so it's best to open Dev Tools and check what element to query.

## Icons

In order to confirm the right icon is rendered, you can follow the same steps as you'd do for `<EuiIcon>`.
You should check if the `<button>` (or `<a>` - [see above](#buttons-as-a-elements)) element has a `<svg>` element inside to ensure
an icon is being displayed, and compare the `data-icon-type` attribute value.
It matches the type of icon being displayed on the screen.

## Content (children)

Button content is wrapped in multiple inner elements to ensure correct styles, however, we don't recommend querying
using the inner structure of our components. Instead, you should **read the inner text** of the rendered `<button>`
(or `<a>` - [see above](#buttons-as-a-elements)) and confirm it's what you expected it to be.

You can do that by reading the [`innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText)
or [`textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) properties of the element.
