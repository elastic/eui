**EuiContextMenu** is a nested menu system useful for navigating complicated trees.It lives within
an [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) which itself can be wrapped around any component (like a button in this example).

## Sizes

**EuiContextMenu** supports a small and medium `size`. The default size is medium, `m`, and should be used for most
menus and major actions such as top application menus. Use the smaller size, `s`, for a more compressed version
containing minor actions or repeated menus like in **EuiTable** pagination.

## With single panel

Use **EuiContextMenuPanel** for simple, non-nested context menus. The below pagination example has no nesting and no title.

:::note

The selected context menu item should have an aria-current attribute

**aria-current** tells screen readers which item is selected. Add an `aria-current="true"` attribute
to `EuiContextMenuItem` when a context menu item is clicked or receives a keypress.

## Displaying custom elements

If you have custom content to show instead of a list of options, you can pass a React element
as a child to **EuiContextMenuPanel**.

## Using panels with mixed items & content

Context menu panels can be passed React elements through the `content` prop instead of `items`.
The panel will display your custom content without modification.

If your panel contents have different widths or you need to ensure that a specific context menu panel
has a certain width, add `width: [number of pixels]` to the panel tree.

You can add separator lines in the `items` prop if you define an item as `{isSeparator: true}`.
This will pass the rest of its fields as props to a [**EuiHorizontalRule**](#/layout/horizontal-rule) component.
