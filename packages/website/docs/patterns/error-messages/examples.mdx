# Error examples

## 400: Bad request
The server can’t process the information because it’s not complete or is in the wrong format.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `400` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**You must fix the following**<br/>
Your email must contain an @ character. The date you registered must be in the past
:::

## 401: Unauthorized
Do not use error pages for authentication errors (`401` error codes). Instead, if the user is logged out automatically, actively redirect them to the login page when it happens and explain why they were logged out using the [error banner pattern](./error-banners.mdx).

## 403: Forbidden
The user doesn’t have permissions to do what they’re trying to do.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `403` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**You can’t access this page**<br/>
You don’t have permission. If you think this is a mistake, contact your administrator: [admin@example.co](#).
:::

## 404: Not found
The page is missing. This is when the user typed a bad URL or clicked on a broken link. It’s different from `410 Gone` where we know that the page has been deleted.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `404` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**We can’t find the page you’re looking for**<br/>
If you typed in the URL, check it’s correct. If you clicked a link, contact your administrator and tell them it’s broken: [admin@example.co](#).
:::

## 408: Request timeout
The server did not respond after an acceptable amount of time.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `408` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**The page took too long to load**<br/>
This is probably temporary. Wait 1 minute and try again. If this keeps happening, contact your administrator: admin@example.co.
:::

## 410: Gone
Similar to `404`, but instead of being missing we know it’s been deleted.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `404` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**This page has been permanently deleted**<br/>
You can go back, or go home.
:::

## 429: Too many requests
The user has tried too many actions in a short space of time.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `429` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**We’ve temporary limited what you can do**<br/>
We have a limit of 30 actions per minute, per user. Wait 1 minute and then try again. If this keeps happening contact your administrator: [admin@example.co](#).
:::

## 500: Internal server error
A generic status code, usually used when the application crashes for some unknown reason. It is acceptable to apologize when handling a `500` error.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `500` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**Sorry, there’s a problem with the application**<br/>
We aren’t sure what went wrong. If this keeps happening, contact your administrator: admin@example.co with the error code: 0x000345.
:::
## 502: Bad gateway
The server reached out to another system and got a response, but could not complete the action for some reason..

Use the [error banner pattern](./error-banners.mdx) for `502` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**We could not save your data to AWS**<br/>
We don’t know what went wrong. You can try again. If this keeps happening, contact your administrator: [admin@example.co](#).
:::
## 503: Service unavailable
The server can’t do what you asked it to do. It may be overloaded or offline for maintenance. It is acceptable to apologize when handling a `503` error.

Use the [error page pattern](./error-page.mdx) for `503` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**Sorry, there’s a problem with the application**<br/>
It might just be busy. Wait for 1 minute and try again. If this keeps happening, contact your administrator: [admin@example.co](#).
:::
## 504: Gateway timeout
The server reached out to another system, but the other system took too long to respond.

Use the [error banner pattern](./error-banners.mdx) for `504` errors.

**Good example:**
:::tip
**We could not save your data to AWS**<br/>
AWS took too long to respond. It might just be busy. Wait 1 minute and try again. If this keeps happening, contact your administrator: [admin@example.co](#).
:::

## 507: Insufficient storage
The storage space on the server has run out.

Use the [error banner pattern](./error-banners.mdx) for `507` errors.

ur storage is full. You can delete some data and try again, or you can contact your administrator to upgrade your storage: [admin@example.](#).
