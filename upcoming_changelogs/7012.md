- Added React 18 support (StrictMode not yet supported).

**Breaking changes**

- Replaced the underlying drag-and-drop library from `react-beautiful-dnd` to its fork `@hello-pangea/dnd` ([#7012](https://github.com/elastic/eui/pull/7012))
  - No code updates are needed if using only `<EuiDragDropContext>`, `<EuiDroppable>` and `<EuiDraggable>` with no direct imports from `react-beautiful-dnd`. In case you were importing things from `react-beautiful-dnd` and using them together with EUI components, you need to switch to `@hello-pangea/dnd` which has cross-compatible API.
