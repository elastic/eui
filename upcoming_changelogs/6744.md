- Updated `EuiFocusTrap` to support the `gapMode` prop configuration (now defaults to `padding`)

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed the `scrollLock` property on `EuiFocusTrap` (and other components using `EuiFocusTrap`, such as `EuiFlyout` and `EuiModal`) to no longer block scrolling on nested portalled content, such as combobox dropdowns
