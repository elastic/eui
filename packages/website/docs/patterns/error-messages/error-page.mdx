# Error page

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Use an error page when it is not possible to show the user the page they expected to see.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="403 Example" label="403 Example" default>
    ![An empty prompt component which reads, 403, you can't access this page. You don't have permission, if you think this is a mistake, contact your administrator: admin@example.co.](./images/error-page-403.webp)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="404 Example">
    ![An empty prompt component which reads, 404, we can't find the page you're looking for. If you typed the URL, check it's correct. If you clicked a link, contact your administrator: admin@example.co.](./images/error-page-404.webp)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## When to use this pattern

Use an error page when it is not possible to show the user the page they expected to see. For example:
- `403`: user does not have permission
- `404`: cannot find page or resource
- `410`: page or resource has been deleted

We have created a list of [example error messages for common error codes](./examples.mdx).

## When not to use this pattern

Error pages are a hard stop in the user's journey. They can be jarring and annoying to encounter.

Do not use an error page to display a warning about an unrelated error, instead use the [error warning pattern](./error-warning.mdx).

Do not use an error page for validating information the user has entered, instead use the [validation errors pattern](./error-validation.mdx).

Do not use an error page when you're able to still show the page the user was expecting, instead use the [error banner pattern](./error-banners.mdx).


## How it works

Use the [EuiEmptyPrompt](../../components/display/empty-prompt/index.mdx) component to build your error pages.

Redirect the user to your error page in situations where an error occurs and the expected page can't be shown.
