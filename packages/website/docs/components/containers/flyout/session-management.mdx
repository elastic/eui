# Flyout session management <EuiBetaBadge label="Beta" color="accent" /> {#flyout-session-management}

EuiFlyout comes with opt-in flyout session management built in that lets you
effortlessly create complex flyout compositions and journeys.
It handles side-by-side flyout rendering based on parent-child grouping,
simple flyout transitions, state sharing, and more.

```tsx interactive
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  EuiButton,
  EuiFlyout,
  EuiFlyoutBody,
  EuiSpacer,
  EuiFormRow,
  EuiFieldText,
  EuiText,
  EuiCode,
} from "@elastic/eui";

export default () => {
  const [isOpenFlyoutA, setIsOpenFlyoutA] = useState(false);
  const [isOpenFlyoutB, setIsOpenFlyoutB] = useState(false);
  const [isOpenFlyoutBChild, setIsOpenFlyoutBChild] = useState(false);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <EuiButton disabled={isOpenFlyoutA} onClick={() => setIsOpenFlyoutA((val) => !val)}>Open Flyout A</EuiButton>
      {isOpenFlyoutA && (
        <EuiFlyout
          session="start"
          size="s"
          aria-label="Flyout A - main"
          flyoutMenuProps={{
            title: 'Welcome to the flyout session management journey!',
          }}
          onClose={() => setIsOpenFlyoutA(false)}
        >
          <EuiFlyoutBody>
            <EuiText>This flyout is rendered with the <EuiCode>{'session="start"'}</EuiCode> prop set which creates a new flyout session and marks this flyout as main.</EuiText>
            <EuiSpacer />
            <EuiFormRow label="What's your name?" fullWidth>
              <EuiFieldText value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
            </EuiFormRow>
            <EuiSpacer />
            <EuiButton onClick={() => { setIsOpenFlyoutB(true); }}>Next step</EuiButton>
          </EuiFlyoutBody>
        </EuiFlyout>
      )}
      {isOpenFlyoutB && (
        <EuiFlyout
          session="start"
          size="m"
          aria-label="Flyout B - main"
          flyoutMenuProps={{
            title: <>Glad to meet you, {name || 'stranger'}!</>,
          }}
          onClose={() => setIsOpenFlyoutB(false)}
        >
          <EuiFlyoutBody>
            <EuiText>
              This flyout is also rendered with the <EuiCode>{'session="start"'}</EuiCode> prop added which creates a <strong>second flyout session</strong> and marks this flyout as main in that session.
              <br /><br />
              The first flyout still exists but is currently hidden since this one took precedence. You can jump back to it by clicking the <i>Back</i> button above if you'd like.
            </EuiText>
            <EuiSpacer />
            <EuiButton onClick={() => setIsOpenFlyoutBChild((val) => !val)}>
              {isOpenFlyoutBChild ? 'Close child flyout' : 'Open child flyout'}
            </EuiButton>
          </EuiFlyoutBody>
          {isOpenFlyoutBChild && (
            <EuiFlyout size="s" aria-label="Flyout B - child" onClose={() => setIsOpenFlyoutBChild(false)}>
              <EuiFlyoutBody>
                <EuiText>
                  This is a <strong>child flyout</strong> of Flyout B. It belongs to the same session as Flyout B because it's rendered inside of it and doesn't have the <EuiCode>session</EuiCode> prop set.
                  <br /><br />
                  If you close <i>Flyout B - main</i>, this flyout will close, too.
                </EuiText>
                <EuiSpacer />
                <EuiText>Try out the Back button to transition back to Flyout A ➡️</EuiText>
                <EuiSpacer />
                <EuiButton onClick={() => { setIsOpenFlyoutB(false); setIsOpenFlyoutA(false); }}>Close all</EuiButton>
              </EuiFlyoutBody>
            </EuiFlyout>
          )}
        </EuiFlyout>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```

## Sessions

The `session` prop is the key ingredient needed to create managed flyouts.
When set to `start`, it activates the underlying flyout session management logic
which handles virtually everything you need to create multi-flyout user flows
including side-by-side flyouts and flyout stacks with history support.

Managed flyouts work seamlessly with other managed and unmanaged (regular)
flyouts across the application, so you can begin integrating them without worry
about compatibility issues.

Each time you set `session="start"`, you create a new flyout session and mark
the rendered flyout as [main](#main-flyouts).
To create a [child flyout](#child-flyouts) - a flyout that belongs to the same
session as the main flyout - you can set `session="inherit"` or omit the `session` prop entirely,
as "inherit" is the default behavior.
All bindings and configuration will be handled automatically.

### Session title

Flyout sessions within the managed system require a title that can be
referenced in the history navigation features. Use the `title`
field of the `flyoutMenuProps` to set the title of the flyout.

```tsx
{/* Render a new main flyout and create a flyout session */}
<EuiFlyout
  session="start"
  flyoutMenuProps={{
    title: 'My main flyout'
  }}
>
  <EuiFlyoutBody>
    I'm the main flyout
  </EuiFlyoutBody>
  {/* Render a new child flyout - notice the lack of the `session` prop */}
  <EuiFlyout
    flyoutMenuProps={{
      title: 'My child flyout'
    }}
  >
    I'm the child flyout that belongs to the same session as the main flyout
  </EuiFlyout>
</EuiFlyout>
```

To prevent a flyout from being a part of the session management system, you
can set `session="never"` which will render it as a regular unmanaged flyout.

```tsx
<>
  {/* Render a new main flyout and create a flyout session */}
  <EuiFlyout
    session="start"
    flyoutMenuProps={{
      title: 'My flyout in a session'
    }}
  >
    <EuiFlyoutBody>
      I'm the main flyout in a session
    </EuiFlyoutBody>
  </EuiFlyout>
  {/* Render a non-session flyout */}
  <EuiFlyout session="never">
    I'm a flyout that will not be part of any flyout session
  </EuiFlyout>
</>
```

## Types of managed flyouts

While users of managed flyouts don't need to think about the types
of managed flyouts or the internals behind them, it's beneficial to understand
what differentiates the two types - _main_ and _child_.

### Main flyouts

Main flyouts are the backbone of EuiFlyout's session management. Each flyout
with `session="start"` prop creates a new session and becomes the main flyout
in that session. They're included in the history and can be jumped back to
using the history popover.

Main flyouts are meant to display primary level information like the overview
of an alert.

### Child flyouts

Child flyouts are directly related to a main flyout in their session.
They're created by rendering a `EuiFlyout` **without the session prop** inside
a [main flyout](#main-flyouts) - a flyout with `session="start"` prop set.

They're meant to display secondary level information like the alert visualization.

Child flyouts accept an optional `hasChildBackground` boolean prop that lets you change
the style of the flyout background to shaded ([`colors.backgroundBaseSubdued`](../../../getting-started/theming/tokens/colors/index.mdx#:~:text=colors.backgroundBaseSubdued)).

On smaller screens, child flyouts stack above the parent.

## Accessibility

Both parent and child flyouts use `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` for accessibility. Focus is managed automatically between them, with the child flyout taking focus when open and returning focus to the parent when closed.
