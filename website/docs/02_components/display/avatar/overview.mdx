The **EuiAvatar** component typically creates a user icon.
It will accept `name` (required) and `image` props and will configure the display and accessibility as needed.
By default, the background colors come from the set of colors used for visualizations.
Otherwise, you can pass a hex value to the `color` prop.

<!-- TODO: Add basic EuiAvatar example -->

## Initials

The initials displayed in the avatar try to be smart based on the name prop.
If the name contains spaces, it will display the first character of each word, **always maxing out at 2 characters**.
You can customize this by passing a combination of `initialsLength` and/or `initials` props.
However, the avatar will still always max out at 2 characters.

## Types

The avatar `type`, which primarily defines the shape, is keyworded and can be `"user"` (default)
or `"space"` (for workspaces).

<!-- TODO: Add spaces example -->

## Icons

Icons can also be displayed instead of initials or images. When simply passing an `iconType`,
it will both size and color appropriately based on the other **EuiAvatar** props.
To customize these specifically, pass `iconSize` and `iconColor`.

If your icon has multiples or custom colors like a logo, you can keep the default `iconColor` by passing `null`.
Otherwise, it will get the appropriate contrast acceptable variant.
Just ensure that you also are providing an accessible background color to match that of the icon's color.

## Disabled

While **EuiAvatar** doesn't accept any interactive behaviors itself, you can create a visually presented disabled
avatar by adding `isDisabled` when placed within a disabled element.
