**EuiLink** is any anchor or button element that is designed to display nicely within a block of text.
It also provides more anchor-specific styling onto links and makes sure they are accessible.

## External links

Setting `target="_blank"` defaults to `external={true}`. This adds an icon indicator instructing users that
a new window will open. You can also manually apply this icon in case you handle the target behavior by other means.

## Coloring links

Like any other [button component](#/navigation/button), links can be passed a `color`. Note that the `ghost`
type should only be used on dark backgrounds (regardless of theming) as it will always create a white link.

## Disabled links

When an **EuiLink** is passed an `onClick` method, and is not passed an `href`, it can optionally
be set to`disabled` which disables the click behavior, and removes the link styling.

## Link validation

To make links more secure for users, **EuiLink** and other components that accept an `href` prop become disabled
if that `href` uses the `javascript:` protocol. This helps protect consuming applications
from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and mirrors React's
[planned behavior(opens in a new tab or window)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/940f48b999a3131e77b2545bd7ae252ef27ae6d1/packages/react-dom/src/shared/sanitizeURL.js#L37)
to prevent rendering of `javascript:` links.
