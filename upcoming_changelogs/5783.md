**Bug fixes**

- Fixed `EuiContextMenu` stranding keyboard focus when pressing the left/right arrow keys quickly between more than 2 panels
- Fixed `EuiContextMenu` to enable up/down arrow key navigation to all focusable `items`
- Fixed `EuiContextMenu` to enable using the up/down arrow keys to navigate to the panel title back button (which takes the user to the previous panel), and focus this button if `initialFocusedItemIndex` has not been set
