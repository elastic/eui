Use the **EuiPopover** component to hide controls or options behind a clickable element.
A popover is temporary so keep tasks simple and narrowly focused.

While the visibility of the popover is maintained by the consuming application, popovers will automatically
close when clicking outside of the popover bounds. Therefore all work done in a popover should automatically be saved.

Avoid popover inception (popover triggering another popover),
and instead use a [**EuiContextMenu**](#/navigation/context-menu) to swap the popover panel content.

## Anchor position

The alignment and arrow on your popover can be set with the `anchorPosition` prop.
These positions will update based upon screen real estate.

**Some tips:**

*   The first word in the `anchorPosition` denotes where the popover will appear relative to the button.
*   The second word in the `anchorPosition` denotes where the gravity / pin position
    will appear relative to the popover.

## Popover titles and footers

Popovers often need titling. Use the **EuiPopoverTitle** component nested somewhere inside the popover contents.

You can also add a similarly styled **EuiPopoverFooter** for smaller captions or call to action buttons.

## Popover padding sizes

Use the `panelPaddingSize` prop to adjust the padding of the panel content. When using popover titles and footers,
this setting will propogate to them. Or you can supply a custom `paddingSize` to either the **EuiPopoverTitle**
of **EuiPopoverFooter**.

## Panel class name

Use the `panelClassName` prop to pass a custom class to the panel containing the popover contents.

## Popover with block level display

Popover anchors default to `display: inline-block;` so they do not force a display on inline triggers.
If you do need to change this, just add `display="block"`

## Popover on a fixed element

Popover content even works on `position: fixed;` elements. Add the `repositionOnScroll` boolean prop
to ensure the popover realigns to the fixed button on scroll.

## Constraining a popover inside a container

**EuiPopover** can accept a React or DOM element as a `container` prop and restrict the popover
from overflowing that container.

## Popover attached to input element

**EuiInputPopover** is a specialized popover component intended to be used with form elements.
Stylistically, the popover panel is "attached" to the input. As a result, the popover will always try to set its width
to match the width of the input, although this can be configured via `panelMinWidth`.

Functionally, consumers have control over what events open and close the popover,
and it can allow for natural tab order. Although some assumptions are made about keyboard behavior, consumers should
provide specific key event handlers depending on the use case. For instance, a `type=text` input could use the down key
to trigger popover opening, but this interaction would not be appropriate for `type=number` inputs as they natively
bind to the down key.

## Setting an initial focus

If you want a specific child element of the popover to immediately gain focus when the popover is open,
use the `initialFocus` prop to pass either a selector or DOM node.

:::warning

It can be jarring for keyboard and screen reader users to immediately land on an element with no other context.
To alleviate this, ensure that your initial focus target makes sense alone or is the primary goal of the popover.

## Custom outside click behavior

If you do not wish the popover to auto-close on outside clicks, you can use `focusTrapProps`
to customize this behavior. The below example triggers a confirmation modal which can leave the popover
open if the user presses 'No'.

## Removing the focus trap

If the popover should not trap focus within itself, then you can remove it with `ownFocus={false}`.

:::warning

Removing `ownFocus` makes it difficult for keyboard-only and screen reader users to navigate to and from your popover.

## Popover using an HTMLElement as the anchor

**EuiWrappingPopover** is an extra popover component that allows any existing DOM element
to be passed as the `button` prop.
