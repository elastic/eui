title: Chat interface
---

Interface dedicated to conduct conversations with the Elastic AI Assistant.

The chat interface is designed to mimic the natural flow of a conversation, providing a familiar and intuitive medium for users to engage with the _AI Assistant_, seek assistance, ask questions, and receive guidance.

## When to use

#### Complex queries

When users have specific, complex questions that require a conversational context to understand and resolve

#### Guided assistance

For step-by-step guidance through intricate workflows or troubleshooting

#### Personalized interactions

When users seek tailored advice or insights based on their data.

## Chat skeleton

The chat interface is structured into the following containers:

1. **Chat header** - itâ€™s purpose is to provide top level controls,
which are impacting things outside of the conversation.
2. **Conversation header** - this area displays the name of the
conversation and gives quick access to controls which may impact the conversation
such as, edit title, change Connector, enabled Knowledge base etc.
3. **Conversation body** - this area is structured as a conversation timeline,
where a user can see and interact in a top to bottom, old to new display of messages
and events.
4. **Chat footer** - the footer is constructed of three layers
which can be used for adding/changing/updating the text input to enrich or change
the request which will be made to the assistant: input mode, from text to document,
JSON schema mode adding context, and adding prompts.

## Chat message skeleton

The chat message is a dynamic component engineered to support various message states. This offers customisation options that enhance the user experience thoughtfully.

**Chat message header** - designated section to identify the message's author, with the current setup featuring two participants: the user, and the _AI Assistant_. On the right side, there's an interactive actions area, providing space to incorporate additional actions.

2. **Chat message body** - central area which hosts the message's content, ranging from simple text to complex elements like tables, visualisations or codeblocks.

3. **Chat message footer** - positioned at the bottom, this segment contains actions, with options such as feedback on the message's helpfulness, triggers to regenerate the message, etc.
