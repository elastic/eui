**EuiDescriptionList** is a component for listing pairs of information together. You can use the component on its own,
passing in an object for the list.

You can also use the **EuiDescriptionListTitle** and **EuiDescriptionListDescription** components separately
to build a list manually.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Reverse style

Setting the `textStyle` prop to `reverse` will reverse the text styles of the `title` and `description` elements
so that the description is more prominent. This works best for key/value type content.

Adding this property to the `inline` type will not change anything.

<!-- TODO: Add reverse style example -->

## As columns

Using the prop `type` set to `column` description lists can be presented in an inline, column format.

<!-- TODO: Add columns example -->

To return to the typical row format on smaller screens set `type` to `responsiveColumn`.
The following list will only show the column format on larger screens.

<!-- TODO: Add responsiveColumn example -->

The optional `columnWidths` prop allows customizing specific column widths (e.g. `['100px', '200px']`).
The first array value applies to the title column, and the second applies to the description column.

Passing numbers instead of CSS width strings will use a ratio of widths. For example, `[1, 3]` will render
a description column 3x the width of the title column. In other words, titles will have a width
of 25% descriptions will have a width of 75%.

For advanced usage, column width strings also accept
[CSS grid special units, sizing, keywords, and sizing functions](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#aa-special-units-functions).

<!-- TODO: Add advanced usage example -->

## Inline

Using a prop `type` set to `inline` description lists can be presented in an inline, blob format.
This is useful for JSON code blocks. Inline description lists are sized smaller than normal lists due
to their compact nature.

<!-- TODO: Add inline example -->

## Customizing appearance

### Alignment & Compression

Utilize the `align` and `compressed` props to refine the presentation of your description list.
These are compatible with both column and inline types.

### Vertical spacing

Modify the `rowGutterSize` prop to control the vertical spacing between `EuiDescriptionList` elements.
This will not affect inline list types.

### Horizontal spacing

Adjust the spacing between the title and description with the `columnGutterSize` prop.
This will not affect inline or row types.

<!-- TODO: Add customizing appearance example -->

## Passing className

When using the `listItems` prop to pass an object of items and you need to also add a `className`
(or other available prop) to the individual pieces, you can use the `titleProps` and `descriptionProps` to do so.
