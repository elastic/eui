:::warning Understanding precision

Range sliders should only be used when **the precise value is not considered important**.
If the precise value does matter, add the `showInput` prop or use a **EuiFieldNumber** instead.

:::

## Single range

### Required

* `min, max`: Sets the range values.
* `step`: Technically not required because the default is `1`.
* `value, onChange`

### Optional

* `showLabels`: While currently considered optional, the property should be added
  to explicitly state the range to the user.
* `showValue`: Displays a tooltip style indicator of the selected value.
  You can add `valuePrepend` and/or `valueAppend` to bookend the value with custom content.
* `showRange`: Displays a thickened line from the minimum value to the selected value.

## Dual range

The **EuiDualRange** accepts almost all the same props as the regular **EuiRange**, with the exception of `showRange`
which is on by default, and `showValue` since tooltips don't fit properly when there are two.

:::warning

Retrieving field values

Two-value `input[type=range]` elements are not part of the HTML5 specification.
Because of this support gap, **EuiDualRange** cannot expose a native `value` property for native form to consumption.
**The React `onChange` prop is the recommended method for retrieving the upper and lower values.**

**EuiDualRange** does use native inputs to help validate step values and range limits.
These may be used as form values when `showInput` is in use. The alternative is to store values in `input[type=hidden]`.

## Inputs

The `showInput` prop, will append or bookend the range slider with number type inputs.
This is important for allowing precise values to be entered by the user.

Passing empty strings as the `value` to the ranges, will allow the inputs to be blank, though the range handles
will show at the min (or max and min) positions.

## Tick marks

To show clickable tick marks and labels at a given interval, add the prop `showTicks`.
By default, tick mark interval is bound to the `step` prop, however, you can set a custom interval
without changing the actual steps allowed by passing a number to the `tickInterval` prop.

To pass completely custom tick marks, you can pass an array of objects that require a `value` and `label`.
The value must be included in the range of values (min-max), though the label may be anything you choose.

:::warning

Minimum of 5px width per tick allowed

If the width available for each tick displayed is below 5px, the range component will error.
Test your usage at multiple screen widths to ensure all ticks are visible on the page at all times,
or use EUI's `useIsWithinBreakpoints` [hook utility](#/theming/breakpoints/values?themeLanguage=js) to reduce
the tick interval responsively.

## Levels

To create colored indicators for certain intervals, pass an array of objects that include a `min`, `max`
and `color`. Color options are `[ "primary", "success", "warning", "danger" ]`
or a valid CSS color value (e.g. `"#ff0000"`, `"red"`).

Be sure to then add an `aria-describedby` and match it to the id of a **EuiFormHelpText**.

## Inputs with range in a dropdown

Passing `showInput="inputWithPopover"` instead of a boolean will only display the inputs until the input
is interacted with in which case a dropdown will appear displaying the actual slider.

## Kitchen sink

Other alterations you can add to the range are `fullWidth`, and `disabled`.
