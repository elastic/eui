**Bug fixes**

- Table `mobileOptions`:
  - `mobileOptions.align` is now respected instead of all cells being forced to left alignment
  - `textTruncate` and `textOnly` are now respected even if a `render` function is not passed

**Breaking changes**

- Removed top-level `textOnly` prop from `EuiBasicTable` and `EuiInMemoryTable`. Use `columns[].textOnly` instead.

**DOM changes**

- `EuiTableRowCell` no longer renders mobile headers to the DOM unless the current table is displaying its responsive view.
- `EuiTableHeaderCell` and `EuiTableRowCell` will no longer render in the DOM at all on mobile if their columns' `mobileOptions.show` is set to `false`.
- `EuiTableHeaderCell` and `EuiTableRowCell` will no longer render in the DOM at all on desktop if their columns' `mobileOptions.only` is set to `true`.
