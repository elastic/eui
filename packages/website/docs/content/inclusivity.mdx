# Inclusivity

This page provides guidelines for writing inclusive UI copy for product content but it's not exhaustive.

## What is inclusive content and why does it matter

**Inclusivity** for content means making sure that the content we serve reflects the diversity of our community, respects it, and promotes positive change.

## Guidelines

### Write for an international audience

Our products use American English (en_US) as a standard for written content.
Yet they are used, read by persons all around the globe, for whom English is not always their primary language.
Our content must take that into account.

✔️ **Aim for simplicity.** Indeed, we are a technical company, writing for
  technically-savvy users. However, it benefits everyone if we try to keep our writing as simple as possible.

  * **Short sentences** - They leave less space for interpretation. They are easier to scan, read, and translate.

  * **Plain language** -  Use active voice, present tense, using examples, and so on.
  Some of these guidelines might already look familiar. Several countries have
  [plain language initiatives](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) to
  promote clearer communication. Do your
  best to embrace these guidelines and focus on the message.

  * **Negation** - It is easier to say what something IS
  versus what it is NOT. When you add a negative construction, it takes the
  reader longer to parse the meaning of the phrase. For example, instead of saying "You cannot access the content without signing up", say "Sign up to access the content."

  * **Words with multiple meanings** -
  Don't skip helper words if they make the sentence clearer and easier to read. In UI copy, we try to be as literal and unambiguous as possible to ensure that it can be easily consumed by our users from around the globe. One way to achieve that is to choose words that have fewer meanings, especially when a word's intended meaning is not its primary meaning.

✔️ **Be aware of differences and diversity in content and examples.**
Different people are used to different names, currencies, date and time formats, different units of measurement (like for temperature, distance, speed), and so much more.
* Avoid ambiguous values, like `04/05/06` for a date. Is it May 4 or April 5, and which year? `11/17/1987` leaves less room for interpretation if the exact format is not specified nearby.
* If there is no obvious example standard (RFC) to follow, try to be diverse to represent our audience.

✔️ **Avoid idioms or expressions that are not commonly known, a.k.a regionalisms.**

In our Elastic documentation we aim for a fun, friendly, and sometimes quirky
tone. To achieve that, it can help to use informal, playful language. However, we also have to be careful that our text is as inclusive as possible, so we try to avoid expressions that might be unknown or opaque for some users. Here are a few examples of what to avoid:

* Idioms (for example, _It's a piece of cake_ or _So far so good_)
* Regional expressions (for example, _G'day!_, _Y'all_, or _eh_)
* Sports expressions (for example, _touched base_ or _threw a curve ball_)
* Pop culture references (for example, _Elvis has left the building_ or _Same bat-time, same bat-channel_)

We're all pretty good at avoiding these, but there's one problematic type of
expression that sometimes shows up in UI copy. Latin terms and
abbreviations are a common source of confusion, particularly for people whose
first language does not have Latin roots.

Here are some terms to avoid and suggested alternatives:

| Avoid      |  | Use instead     |
--- | --- | ---
| _e.g._ (exempli gratia) | → | _for example_ |
| _etc._ (et cetera) | → | _and more_ or _and so on_ |
| _i.e._ (id est) | → | _that is_ |
| _via_ | → | _by way of_, _by means of_, or _through_ |

✔️ **Aim for readability.** Tools like the [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) can help you make content simpler. Be conversational, but prioritize clarity.

### Use gender-neutral language

Writing gender-neutral mainly consists in avoiding gender bias and word choices implying that one gender is the norm.

✔️ **Pronouns.** In the UI, this can be avoided by addressing users directly.
When it's not possible, use *they*/*their*, even for singular. There's more than one gender, and it's not binary either.

✔️ **Biased words and expressions.** Guys, mankind, policeman... Words that we're all used to hear and use. But the default is not male.
Most expressions and words that perpetuate this bias (that exists in many cultures and languages!) can be replaced with neutral alternatives or synonyms: Folks, humanity, police officer...

### Avoid violent, offensive, ableist terminology

Earlier in this page, we discussed avoiding ambiguous terms, especially when a word's intended meaning is
not its primary meaning. Other types of words and phrases best avoided are:

* buzzwords (_incentivize_, _synergies_)
* superhero terms (_rock star_, _wizard_, _ninja_)
* violent imagery (_crush the competition_)
* non-specific superlatives (_unrivaled_, _unparalleled_, _world class_)

Some words have nuances that fall into the above categories, which may cause
them to be misinterpreted. Here are some alternatives:

| Avoid      |      | Use instead   |
--- | --- | ---
| Abort	     | → | _stop_, _cancel_, or _end_ |
| Boot 	     | → | _start_ or _run_ |
| Execute     | → | _run_ or _complete_ |
| Hack (noun) | → | _tip_ or _workaround_ |
| Hack (verb) | → | _configure_ or _modify_ |
| Hit (verb)  | → | _click_ or _press_ |
| Hit (noun)  | → | _visits_ (as in _website visits_) |
| Invalid     | → | _not valid_ or _incorrect_ |
| Kill		  | → | _cancel_ or _stop_ |
| Terminate	  | → | _stop_ or _exit_ |
