# Flex items

:::warning
To work correctly, **EuiFlexItem** must be a **direct child** of [EuiFlexGroup](./group.mdx) or [EuiFlexGrid](./grid.mdx). You cannot have any intermediate HTML wrappers between them.
:::

import { createDemo } from '@elastic/eui-docusaurus-theme/components';
import { FlexPreviewWrapper } from './flex_preview_wrapper';
import DemoNote from './_flex_preview_note.mdx';

export const FlexDemo = createDemo({ previewWrapper: FlexPreviewWrapper });

<DemoNote />

## Flex items are also flex

To allow for continued stretching of nested flex groups/grids and their items, each **EuiFlexItem** also has the property of `display: flex`.

This can sometimes cause unwanted layouts of your content when there are multiple elements, or if the element itself also has some specific `display` property. To alleviate this, the simplest method is to wrap your inner children with a HTML wrapper like a `<div />` or `<span />`.

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiButton } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <EuiFlexGroup>
      <EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiButton fill>Buttons will widen</EuiButton>
      </EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiFlexItem>
        <div>
          <EuiButton fill>Unless you wrap them</EuiButton>
        </div>
      </EuiFlexItem>
    </EuiFlexGroup>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>

Alternatively, you can sometimes opt to omit **EuiFlexItem** completely.

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiButton } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <EuiFlexGroup justifyContent="spaceBetween" alignItems="center">
      <EuiPanel grow={false}>
        Flex group parents will still <br /> align children as usual
      </EuiPanel>
      <EuiButton fill>Look ma, no EuiFlexItem</EuiButton>
    </EuiFlexGroup>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>

## Panels grow vertically to fill flex items

The [EuiPanel](../../containers/panel/index.mdx) component will naturally grow to fill the **EuiFlexItem** which contains it.

```tsx interactive
import React from 'react';
import {
  EuiFlexItem,
  EuiFlexGroup,
  EuiPanel,
  EuiCode,
  EuiText,
} from '@elastic/eui';

export default () => (
  <EuiFlexGroup>
    <EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiText>
        <p>
          <EuiCode>FlexItem</EuiCode>
        </p>
        <p>A side nav might be in this one.</p>
        <p>And you would want the panel on the right to expand with it.</p>
      </EuiText>
    </EuiFlexItem>

    <EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiPanel>
        <strong>EuiPanel</strong>
      </EuiPanel>
    </EuiFlexItem>

    <EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiPanel grow={false}>
        Another <strong>EuiPanel</strong>, with{' '}
        <EuiCode>grow=&#123;false&#125;</EuiCode>.
      </EuiPanel>
    </EuiFlexItem>
  </EuiFlexGroup>
);
```

## Grow

:::warning
The `grow` prop of **EuiFlexItem** only applies when used within [EuiFlexGroup](./group.mdx). It is ignored by [EuiFlexGrid](./grid.mdx), which enforces the same width for each item.
:::

### Turning off item stretching

By default, all **EuiFlexItems** will grow horizontally within their flex group if the `grow` prop is not specified. This can be turned off for each item individually via `grow={false}`.

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <EuiFlexGroup>
      <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>This item won&rsquo;t grow</EuiFlexItem>
      <EuiFlexItem>But this item will.</EuiFlexItem>
    </EuiFlexGroup>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>

### Proportional widths of items

Alternatively, you can specify a `grow` number between 1 and 10 for each **EuiFlexItem** to take up a proportional percentage of the **EuiFlexGroup** it is in.

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiSpacer } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <div>
      <EuiFlexGroup>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={1}>1</EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={2}>
          2<br />
          wraps content if necessary
        </EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={3}>
          3<br />
          expands_to_fit_if_content_cannot_wrap
        </EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={4}>4</EuiFlexItem>
      </EuiFlexGroup>

      <EuiSpacer />

      <EuiFlexGroup>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={6}>6</EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={3}>3</EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={1}>1</EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={3}>3</EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={6}>6</EuiFlexItem>
      </EuiFlexGroup>
    </div>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>
