**Breaking changes**

- Removed the following exported `.css` files:
  - `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_light.css`
  - `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_light.min.css`
  - `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.css`
  - `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.min.css`
- All EUI components are now on CSS-in-JS. A CSS file/import in consuming applications is no longer needed, and is safe to remove.
