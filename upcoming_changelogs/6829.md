**Breaking changes**

- `EuiRange` & `EuiDualRange` no longer have a hard limit of 20 displayed ticks. The component now instead detects the width available, and throws an error if each tick has less than 5 pixels of width. We recommend testing your tick usage at smaller screens to ensure they always display legibly to users.
