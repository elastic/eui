# Table Pagination for basic tables

Patterns and recommendations for handling table pagination on basic tables


Pagination is important for providing better page load times by only loading a subset of items of a long list. However it should be possible for the user to customize this setting to match their needs. The following recommendations are suggested for basic tables, typically in a content management scenario. Large data grid tables or otherwise complex tables may have their unique needs which are not covered here. If possible, it's recommended to use these as a starting point and diverge only when necessary.


### Set a reasonable default

We should default to showing 25 as this provides a balance between a long enough usable list and any performance concerns.

### Provide options of 10, 25, 50, 100

This set of options provides a balance between load performance and ease-of-use.

Optionally, you can include ‘Show all rows’ as the last option if it makes sense with the amount of content.

### Persist choice across pages

If a user decides to choose a different row count, we should save this so it is persisted on subsequent page loads.

### Allow customization

This list of options should be customizable to allow for user preferences.  For Kibana, this should be shown within Advanced settings.

### Avoid infinite scrolling

Our current recommendation is to avoid infinite scrolling for basic management tables. There are concerns with performance aside from general UX issues. However, note that this pertains to basic tables and their are viable scenarios where infinite scrolling makes sense.
