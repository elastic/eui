# Contributing to EUI

ðŸ™Œ Thanks for your interest in contributing to EUI! ðŸ™Œ

When creating a new component, refer to the [Component Creation Guidelines][docs-components].

Always remember to update documentation and the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) in the same PR that contains functional changes. We do this in tandem to prevent our examples from going out of sync with the actual components. In this sense, treat documentation no different than how you would treat tests.

# Changelog style

* Append your changes to the `master` sub-heading of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
* Add a list item for each significant change in the PR: bugs that were fixed, new features, new components, or changes to the public API
* In the list item, always link to any relevant Pull Requests, commit ranges, or individual commits
* Add a short summary of what has changed, making sure it's informative to consumers who might be unaware of implementation details
* Avoid documenting internal implementation changes that don't have an effect on the public interface

# Preparing for a release

When preparing a release, make sure to move the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) changes listed under `master` into a new section titled with the new version number, and link to the `git` tag on GitHub. Come up with a title for the new version, alluding to the major changes since the previous release. Like so:

```markdown
# [`0.0.1`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/v0.0.1) Initial Release
```

### Example

Say you're preparing to release a minor change and the version is currently `0.0.1`. Let's assume that the `CHANGELOG.md` file currently looks like this:

```markdown
# [`master`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/master)

- Fixed an issue where the `wrapText` prop of `<EuiTableRowCell>` wasn't working
- Introduced `<EuiDraggable>` component and documentation
- Improved performance by relying on system fonts, instead of web fonts

# [`0.0.1`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/v0.0.1) Initial Release

- Initial public release
```

We want to release what's in `master` under a new minor version (from `0.0.1`, that's `0.1.0`). Thus, we'll add a new headline for the changes that are currently in `master`, and a note about how `master` is now in sync with the latest release.

```diff
 # [`master`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/master)
+
+ No public interface changes since `0.1.0`.
+
+# [`0.1.0`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/v0.1.0)
 
 - Fixed an issue where the `wrapText` prop of `<EuiTableRowCell>` wasn't working
 - Introduced `<EuiDraggable>` component and documentation
 - Improved performance by relying on system fonts, instead of web fonts
 
 # [`0.0.1`](https://github.com/elastic/eui/tree/v0.0.1) Initial Release
 
 - Initial public release
```

Don't worry about the fact that a `v0.1.0` tag doesn't exist in `git` yet. It will be created for us when [releasing](#releasing) the new version by following the steps described in the next section.

Commit your updates to `CHANGELOG.md` before proceeding with the release.

# Releasing

Once you're ready to ship a new release, run the following command. This command will make sure to run tests, update the documentation website, bump the version patch number (`MINOR.MAJOR.PATCH`), create a new tag on `git`, upload it to GitHub, and ship the new version to `npm`.

```shell
npm run release
```

If you want to bump the minor or major version numbers, just add a `BUMP` environment variable to the command, as shown below:

```shell
BUMP=patch npm run release # default
BUMP=minor npm run release
BUMP=major npm run release
```
