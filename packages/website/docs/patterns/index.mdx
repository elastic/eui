# Overview

Patterns are preferred solutions to specific user needs, ensuring consistency in design, behavior, and interaction.

## What are patterns?

Patterns offer practical solutions that can be applied repeatedly to address frequent design issues, ensuring alignment with our principles and guidelines. They serve as building blocks for creating consistent and cohesive user interfaces.

## How do patterns differ from guidelines?

**Guidelines** are best practices for EUI components that ensure consistency and quality.
They answer "how to use it correctly," providing usage instructions, do's and don'ts, accessibility guidelines, and best practices.

**Patterns** are reusable solutions combining components to solve design problems.
They answer "how to solve this problem," showing component combinations, layout, user flow, interaction, and code examples.
