Generally, tooltips should provide short, **non-essential**, contextual information, usually naming or describing
with more detail. If you need interactive content or anything other than text,
we recommend using [**EuiPopover**](#/layout/popover) instead.

:::warning

Putting anything other than plain text in a tooltip is lost on screen readers.

:::

Wrap **EuiToolTip** around any item that you need a tooltip for and provide the `content` and optionally
the `title`. The `position` prop will take a suggested position, but will change it if the tooltip gets
too close to the edge of the screen.

:::warning

Anchoring a tooltip to a non-interactive element makes it difficult for keyboard-only and screen reader users to read.

## Wrapping components

**EuiToolTip** wraps its children in a `<span>` element that is `display: inline-block`.
If you are wrapping a block-level child (e.g. a `<div>`), you may need to change this by passing
`display="block"` but the resulting DOM may be in violation of the HTML5 spec.

It also applies `onFocus` and `onBlur` props the the cloned `children`. If you pass in a custom component,
then you’ll need to make sure these props are applied to the root element rendered by your component.
The best way to do that is to follow
[EUI’s guidelines on pass-through props](https://github.com/elastic/eui/blob/main/wiki/contributing-to-eui/developing/props.md#pass-through-props).

## Tooltip on a fixed element

Tooltips even work on `position: fixed;` elements. Add the `repositionOnScroll` boolean prop to ensure the tooltip
realigns to the fixed anchor on scroll.

## IconTip

You can use **EuiIconTip** to explain options, other controls, or entire parts of the user interface.
When possible, surface explanations inline within the UI, and only hide them behind a **EuiIconTip** as a last resort.

It accepts all the same props as **EuiToolTip**. For convenience, you can also specify optional
icon `size`, `type`, and`color` props.
