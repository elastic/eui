The tour components provided by EUI allow for a flexible and customizable way to showcase items on a page
in an ordered manner by augmenting existing elements on the page without altering functionality.

ExamplesGuidelines

:::note

The examples on this page, use localStorage to persist state to demonstrate starting a tour at different stages.

:::

## Step options

The **EuiTourStep** component is the base for building a feature tour or an individual popover for onboarding.

All content and actions including titles, headings, and buttons are customizable via props.

### Using DOM selector as anchor location

Instead of wrapping the target element, use the `anchor` prop to specify a DOM node. Accepted values include
an HTML element, a function returning an HTML element, or a DOM query selector.

<!-- TODO: Add DOM selector example -->

## Standalone steps

Each **EuiTourStep** can be configured independently via props. In this case, each component is stateless
and needs to be paired with some form of state management for navigation. The later examples showcase other ways
to handle state management via **useEuiTour** and **EuiTour**.

<!-- TODO: Add standalone steps example -->

## Managed state with the useEuiTour custom hook

Use the **useEuiTour** hook for minimal state management using a predefined React reducer. Pass an array of steps
consisting of accepted props, and an object of global configuration. The result is a full configuration object
for each step, a set of reducer actions to perform state changes, and an up-to-date state object derived from
the internal reducer.

## Managed state via EuiTour render prop component

Use the **EuiTour** render prop component for minimal state management.
This is an alternative to the **useEuiTour** hook for React class components,
or use cases where a single wrapping component can be used.

<!-- TODO: Add render prop example -->

## Passive tour

Use the **EuiTour** to provide sequential help without the user performing any actions
(e.g. filling out a form or copying a text). In this scenario, consider using two buttons, **Close tour** and **Next**.

## Fullscreen demo

Unlike the other examples on this page, this example does not use `localStorage` to persist state.
