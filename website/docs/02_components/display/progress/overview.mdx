The **EuiProgress** component by default will display in an indeterminate loading state (rendered as a single div)
until you define a `max` and `value` prop. The `size` prop refers to its vertical height.
It will always stretch `100%` to its container.

<!-- TODO: Add basic example -->

## Progress with values

Once the `max` and `value` props are set, it will act as a determinate progress bar.
This is rendered using an HTML5 `progress` tag.

<!-- TODO: Add max values example -->

## Progress can have absolute or fixed positions

Using the `position` prop we can align our bar to be `fixed` or `absolute`. In both options, the background color
of the base bar is dropped (since the context of width is already known from your wrapping element).
For the absolute option, make sure that your wrapping element has `position: relative` applied.

:::note

Note about progress bars over fixed headers

Using **EuiProgress** with a `fixed` position may result in it being overlayed when its parent wrapper has
a `z-index` value lower than another fixed element, such as **EuiHeader**. In that case, wrap **EuiProgress**
in an **EuiPortal** as seen on the Snippet tab.

## Sizes

You can adjust the `size` of both determinate and indeterminate progress bars.

## Colors

**EuiProgress** supports a few options for `color`. You can pass any value from our basic color set
or from our visualization palette (`vis0` through `vis9`). To learn more about color usage,
go to the [Colors](#/theming/colors/values) page.

Additionally, you can pass any valid color string like a hex value or named color.
Each `valueText` renders with a high contrast version of the color.

## Progress for charts

Determinate progress bar can be used as simple bar charts. Use them with the `label` and `valueText` props
to show the data corresponding to each bar.

Setting `valueText={true}` will add a % sign next to the `value` passed. If you want to display
a custom `valueText`, you can pass a node instead.
