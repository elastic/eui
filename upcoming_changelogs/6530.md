- Added the `component` prop to `EuiModalHeaderTitle`, which allows overriding the default `h1` tag
- Added the `titleProps` prop to `EuiConfirmModal`, which allows overriding the default `h1` tag

**Breaking changes**

- `EuiModalHeaderTitle` now **always** wraps its children in a `h1` tag (vs. attempting to conditionally detect whether its children are raw strings or not). If an h1 tag is not desired, a more generic `div` can be passed via the new `component` prop.
