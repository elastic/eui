- Added `gutterSize` prop to `EuiTimeline`

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed bug in `EuiTimelineItem` where the vertical line was not showing on the last item when `verticalAlign` was set to `center`
- Fixed bug in `logicalCSS()` where the left and right `logicalPosition`s were wrong

**Breaking changes**

- Removed `component` prop from `EuiTimelineItem`, which now defaults to `li`. Consequently, a `EuiTimeline` (`ol`) is required to wrap the timeline items
