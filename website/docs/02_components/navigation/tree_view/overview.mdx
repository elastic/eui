**EuiTreeView** allows you to render recursive objects, such as a file directory. It is not meant to be used
as primary navigation, for that we recommend using [**EuiSideNav**](#/navigation/side-nav).

**EuiTreeView** does not accept `children` directly but requires an array of `EuiTreeViewNode`s through
its `items` prop.

Each node requires a `label` and a unique `id`. The `icon` prop accepts any [icon or token](#/display/icons).
You can also specify a different icon for the open state with the `iconWhenExpanded` prop.
Use the nodes' `children` prop to nest more nodes.

:::warning

For accessibility, it is required to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for each tree view.
This component also builds in keyboard navigation allowing users to traverse the tree using the arrow keys,
spacebar, and return.

## Optional styling

**EuiTreeView** supports a compressed mode with the `display="compressed"` setting. When using the compressed version
it's highly recommended to use the small size of **EuiIcon** and the extra small size of **EuiToken**.
This will help prevent awkard alignment issues when used alongside the `showExpansionArrows` prop.

The `showExpansionArrows` prop provides an additional visual indicator. Ideal for when a tree's items use icons
that don't immediately let a user know that there are nested nodes that may not be visible.

In some cases, you may want to automatically expand all the items with children. In those instances,
you can use the `expandByDefault` prop, as seen in the example below.

Lastly, each node can also accept a custom `className` should you need to style them individually.
