- Added an opt-in EuiFlyout session management for creating flyout compositions and journeys effortlessly. Session management handles side-by-side flyout rendering based on parent-child grouping, simple flyout transitions with history, state sharing, and more.
  - EuiFlyout session management is an optional feature that can be enabled by adding `session="start"` to EuiFlyout. Check out the [documentation](https://eui.elastic.co/docs/components/containers/flyout/session-management) to learn more.

**Breaking changes**

- Changed the way EuiFlyout renders overlay masks to decouple the overlay mask from the flyout itself. Now, the overlay mask is a separate portalled element.
  - This change does not modify the functionality or behavior of flyout overlays but might affect some custom usages when your application relies on the specific element nesting within EuiFlyout.
