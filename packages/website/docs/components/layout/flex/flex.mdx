# Flex

import { createDemo } from '@elastic/eui-docusaurus-theme/components';
import { FlexPreviewWrapper } from './flex_preview_wrapper';
import DemoNote from './_flex_preview_note.mdx';

## Use cases

- [**EuiFlexGroup**](./group) is useful for single row layouts and for quick alignment of items.
- [**EuiFlexGrid**](./grid) should be used for repeated wrapping rows of same-width items.
- [**EuiFlexItem**](./item) should be used as a direct child of both groups or grids. It can also, depending on the layout, be omitted if its automatic flex or grow behavior is not desired.

## Shared behavior

export const FlexDemo = createDemo({ previewWrapper: FlexPreviewWrapper });

<DemoNote />

### Nesting flex layouts

**EuiFlexGroup** and **EuiFlexGrid** can nest within themselves indefinitely. For example, here we turn off the growth on a **EuiFlexGroup**, then nest a grid inside of it.

:::warning Flex items are also a flexbox

To support nested stretching of items, **EuiFlexItem** also has `display: flex` on it. If your children are not behaving correctly, consider using one of these [flex item workarounds](./item#flex-items-are-also-flex).

:::

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGrid, EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem, EuiSpacer } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <>
      <EuiFlexGroup>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
          <div>Flex Group</div>
          <EuiSpacer />
          <EuiFlexGroup>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Group One</EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Group Two</EuiFlexItem>
          </EuiFlexGroup>
        </EuiFlexItem>
        <EuiFlexItem grow={false}>
          <div>Flex Grid</div>
          <EuiSpacer />
          <EuiFlexGrid columns={3}>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Grid One</EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Grid Two</EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Grid Three</EuiFlexItem>
            <EuiFlexItem>Nested Grid Four</EuiFlexItem>
          </EuiFlexGrid>
        </EuiFlexItem>
      </EuiFlexGroup>
    </>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>

### Overriding output component type

The `component` prop can be passed to either the parent **EuiFlexGroup** or **EuiFlexGrid**, or the child **EuiFlexItem**, to change the rendered component type from the default `div`. It can be any valid React component type like a tag name string such as `div`or `span` or a React component.

This allows you to use semantic tags such as `<form>` with flex layouts, or obey rules around nesting block elements within inline elements.

<FlexDemo>
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { EuiFlexGroup, EuiFlexItem } from '@elastic/eui';

  export default () => (
    <EuiFlexGroup component="p">
      <EuiFlexItem component="span">
        These items are nested within a paragraph tag
      </EuiFlexItem>

      <EuiFlexItem component="span">
        So they use inline span tags to avoid HTML validation issues
      </EuiFlexItem>
    </EuiFlexGroup>
  );
  ```
</FlexDemo>
