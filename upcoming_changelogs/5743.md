- Added all remaining missing i18n tokens for `EuiSuperDatePicker`

**Breaking changes**

- Removed `prettyDuration` utility exported by `EuiSuperDatePicker` - this util was converted to a `PrettyDuration` component and `usePrettyDuration` hook which should be used instead
- Removed `commonDurationRanges` exported by `EuiSuperDatePicker`. The new pretty duration utils will fall back to `commonDurationRanges` by default if no `quickRanges` are passed
