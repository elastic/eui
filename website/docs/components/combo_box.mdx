slug: combo-box
---

Use a **EuiComboBox** when the input has so many options that the user needs to be able to search them,
the user needs to be able to select multiple options, and/or the user should have the ability to specify
a custom value in addition to selecting from a predetermined list. If you're unsure of which selection component
to use, see [EUI's in-depth guide to selection components](https://github.com/elastic/eui/discussions/7049)
for more information.

:::info Accessibility
You must add an accessible label to each instance of EuiComboBox.

Labels can be created by wrapping the combo box in an EuiFormRow with a label, adding an aria-label prop,
or passing a text node ID to the aria-labelledby prop.
